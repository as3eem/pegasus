[["Oh yeah, we have to talk in English, huh. And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design, which you said. Uh according to the coffee uh machine example, I have batteries to supply energy, and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_. Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it? You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function. And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well, so I kind of need to know what we uh need. Whatever, I'll just put my ideas in uh in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting. That is my question also because like new new functions Requirements. And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume. I got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user-friendly. After that we are going to the conceptual uh Okay. And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up. Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard. And you should explain why you draw that particular animal. Yeah you can press the next button, which is uh yeah. And the production cost should be the half of the selling price. I didn't know if you received the same mail. And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far? Uh do they want all those functions on that small Yeah. And um reserve the possibility to add other features. So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible. Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to.", "When the meeting begins the project manager lists the agenda and then describes the project, which is to develop a new remote control that is original, trendy, and user-friendly. The group practices using the smart board by choosing an animal to draw and then explaining why they picked it. The project manager goes over the product budget and they proceed to have discussion. They each identify their individual tasks during each phase based on their role in the group. They briefly discuss characteristics of a desirable remote, including medium size buttons, small unit, and work within a good zapping range. The team again discusses their individual responsibilities and move on to ponder whether the remote will be multifunctional or only for the TV. They decide to first assume it is only for TV and video, but allowing the possibility to add more features. They close the meeting upon establishing what each person will do. "], ["Yeah, it's in the it's in the folder yeah. Okay, this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote. Um and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on. And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used. And so it's taking taking the lead from that. Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down. You can pack all that onto was onto a single control. Um, if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room, um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else. Does that um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable? Um it's come to my attention the following. Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use. If you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or? If you save it in there we can open it up from here. Um, right we can probably skip that for now. Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off, d up and down, it depends, I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined. So that literally anybody can come along, pick up the remote and still know what do do. And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that. B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that, but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert, that might be sales, who are not in this meeting. And that could be something could um separate us a bit. So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_, just so that it says find me, and what, a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit, can maybe hide it in the base. The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now. Because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got you know a small L_C_D_, joystick, e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes, something that can make it stand out slightly. Anything that they think has been missed out. Bit of a wide open question there of course. Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible. Uses maybe gives us a new potential market. ' So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that. Uh, I was still working on stuff, I hadn't got it finished. Click to save in where do I have to save it? Oh, yeah Um, if you go to the next slide then. Should volume be important in the joystick, do you think? Oh, I thought I put in my last name, I guess not, but. Okay, so um we did some research, we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls. I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently, and there were so many buttons, it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button, 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons, you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses. And uh voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already. For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. So if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it. However, oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, there's no need to spend money on research and development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. So we have the three birds, we have the design, that we have the the fancy bit, right, the voice recognition's fancy, it's cool, it's different, it's radical, so, and then we have an extra bit I don't remember so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control, I think is a big question. I had one of those, and my brother, and my dad, could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally.", "The project manager recapped the events of the previous meeting and briefed the team on some new requirements the team must follow when designing the remote. The marketing expert presented research on consumer preferences and user requirements for remotes. The marketing expert also presented information regarding voice recognition and what demographic finds the feature appealing. The user interface designer described the technical functions of a remote and stressed the need for a user focused design. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote. The team then discussed the option to include voice recognition, LCD, and a feature to locate a misplaced remote. The team briefly discussed who they were aiming their product to along with the idea of marketing their product to television manufacturers. The team also decided on some features to include in their product. "], ["And I'm Christine, and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer. Um no, I I have not begun working on the design, and um I uh I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control, I thought we were designing a new monitor. If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month. We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together. I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do. Remote controls, 'cause I had two different things. So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her, so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work, and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in, but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it. So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit. Okay, so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan, okay, a discussion with uh By next meeting, okay that will be great. Oh I think uh, if I'm not wrong, we're making the remote control. Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design? That's Yeah, but uh before we talk about uh the finance, okay, uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also. Okay, of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually. Okay, so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan, okay, including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team, okay, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the the proper project plan. Okay, thanks for coming and uh I wish you a nice time then.", "The group introduced themselves to each other and discussed their roles in the project. The Project Manager opened a discussion about the project plan and asked the Marketing Expert to prepare an overall plan for the project. The Marketing Expert presented the initial aim of the project: the creation of a fresh, user-friendly remote control device. The Project Manager asked the Industrial Designer to create a functional design plan for the device, then asked the Marketing Expert about ideas for the sales strategy. The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan: to analyze the competition and to pinpoint the target marketing group. The Project Manager instructed all participants to work together on their respective design plans. The Project Manager decided that the design plans will be discussed at the next meeting, and that the next step will be to come up with a functional design of the device. "], ["'Cause I have to say something about the material which is quite shocking. Um, yeah, to summarise these are the points that need to be um, touched in order to get a good decision, and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter. Neither was I. Well it's a trend in fashion, in clothing and um fabrics. On the you can just take theirs and just Yeah but should be comfortable. Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, like a Oh, okay, yeah. Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually. So it wouldn't be very big in either like how big? If it's got sand in it maybe, or something, you it it just moulds to your hand. Does anyone have costs on the on the web? Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh. Trying we're gonna try to talk about, um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control, based on fruit vegetable design. Yeah like you're g yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can okay we're not choosing that, I guess. 'Cause you'll have to like but you can quickly s you can Yeah. So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing, um You can get to you know, you can Like maybe it'll be that central button that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ and you can just scroll around, like, to do the timer, to do the yeah, yeah. It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_. Well I guess we have to you know think about But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up. So, but oh, you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen? And it is trendy, the iPods are really hot right now, so Um, yeah, by web research, yeah, so Oh. I mean I think uh and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part. So where are the fruit and vegetables now? Um, so we need some custom design parts, and other parts we'll just use standard. Um, I assume we'll be custom designing our case, probably a hard plastic or some other material case, to protect the remote and the locator. Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do. I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_, not inside the remote. Um, one of your one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things. Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again. We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power. Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways. Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk. Alright we're moving on to conceptual design. You've Yeah, I know what you're saying, you have to But but imagine someone with s But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels. Yeah I mean with that many options, you'd uh I'd think that the screen would be better, because you could have that menu option, sort of Yeah. So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it. And it is technologically innovative in a way, so that fits with the B Yeah. Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit. Um, so what d but what do we know about energy? And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation.", "The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer gave her presentation on components and discussed which would have to be custom-made and which were standard. She also discussed the various materials and chips available. The Marketing Expert presented current trends in the market and in fashion. She discussed the current fruits and vegetables trend and the trend toward softer, spongier materials. The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the remote with the group. They discussed including a touch-based graphical user interface but noted that it was unnecessary and costly. They discussed using the menu function on the television instead. The group discussed how the menu function would be programmed. The group then talked about the casing of the device, and decided that there would be a changeable outer casing. They discussed including fruit colors in addition to the company colors. Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material. The group also discussed energy source options and chips. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype and the Marketing Expert to work on the prototype evaluation. "], ["So this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting. Yes, so still uh we have twelve point five Euro. But anyhow, still we are under control, okay, so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get uh the production cost less, okay, so then we can save some money, okay, to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions, whatever, okay, so that uh I will look after. I don't think that's uh not possible, it's uh okay then, l uh let's wait for the production, okay, then uh you can evaluate the product, so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real. So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks. Or uh Okay, so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation, okay, then uh it's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team, okay, uh from the management, then we can launch in the market. Okay, so then uh Okay uh, let's take like this. So no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. So let's meet up uh this evening to hang up for some party. That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um Yes, okay. Yeah, y better you pass it around with a napkin. Probably not the um the football games coming up the end of January. Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage. But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also, and in mine you'll see uh the problem with uh our survey, the p the possibility that how many units can be sold, what percentage of the market, etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration. So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project. It shouldn't be if it's not it's not the right one. Now, the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production. This is our remote control, with the flip panel as you can see. So if you lift up the panel, you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display. The yellow button you have is the on off button, so it's really big, hard to miss. I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip, it can be on the side somewhere. We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well. Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right, sorry, yes. That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable, 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have, see maybe what other people have done, what the range of possibility as, whereas if you're in a store, you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person, you may not really know what it is you want, whereas on the web, if you have a bunch of pictures, it can sort of trigger ideas and Yeah. 'Cause I mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long. Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it's not a trivial task. We definitely shouldn't do it in our factory. That's actually good place to advertise it too. the Project Manager decided that no additional changes would be made.@highlightThe group then discussed other means of promoting the product:", "The User Interface Designer presented the prototype of the product to the group. The product featured an LCD display, a flip panel, and a customizable case back. The Project Manager displayed the cost of all of the components, and the group decided that the current budget would not allow the addition of the LCD display. The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the addition of the display. The Marketing Expert gave a presentation on sales projection and showed that the current projected sales point would probably not allow the project to reach its profit aim. The group also discussed the distribution and promotion of the product on the internet. The User Interface Designer expressed concern that there would not be time under the current plan to make changes to the product resulting from consumer testing; the Project Manager decided that no additional changes would be made. The group then discussed other means of promoting the product: launching the remote at the same time as a large sporting event or DVD release. "], ["Okay, it's a I think if we both step up and uh outline our ideas. Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder. And making it a bright colour helps with the personally I would have gone for purple. B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could, you know, say hello to, and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice. Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow. That's kinda i it won't be when it's been budgeted. I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie. Well I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh of the researchers studying this. Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves.. Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along, squish. So The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of the remote. But that's what makes it uh original though, isn't it? It can be s yeah, it can still be single curved, but You just. Well, it depends who your who's what the target people are, like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious women would be going, oh look at that, 's cool, it looks like a it's yellow, looks like a banana, it's cool it's gotta look good in the sitting room. So, which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it?. It could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen Euro. Um then we will it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process. Yeah you can tell what room the mobile is Yeah. And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody? Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost. Think we're being generous here with three. Easy to use interface, buttons menu, menus that's yeah that's good. ' Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion. I know, but But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg, Yeah. I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone, and she's had it for a long time, you know. She'd be like is this a remote control, I don't how do you use it, and stuff like that. We we're not lacking in ideas, you know it's that was not the problem. And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this. No and which we will do very very shortly. Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in, we've got point two of a Euro left over there. Even then as well, um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate. It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person. You now have as much information as I do. As you can see, the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick. We might have to It looks like almost nothing Mm. So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display, then that's I believe so, yeah. At which point if Well you got point five there. I'm not quite sure if they're I don't think they mean point five Euros per button. Um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such. Am I do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana? It's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen. Um don't know how lo much longer we've got. Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation. For example um we'll work backwards I suppose. The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with. So maybe this is literally just a way around it. If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector, then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is. Um I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess. Well, they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product. And then the final one where you get to call it Hal. And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers.", "The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented a prototype for the remote the team is designing and discussed its ergonomic appearance and its features. The marketing expert began to lead the team in conducting an evaluation of the prototype but was interrupted when the project manager shifted the discussion to examining the production costs of the team's product. The original specifications of the team's product proved to be too expensive and so the team had to discuss which features to lose and which to maintain in order to meet the target cost. After discussing costs, the team returned to conducting their product evaluation. The prototype was evaluated on the basis of its ability to be located when misplaced, ease of use, appearance, technological innovativeness, and sponginess. Overall, the prototype received average marks. The team then evaluated the project process, finding that they were happy overall but quite displeased with the small budget. "], ["Well my name is Jens Damman, but we're in a group, and I I will start it. So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings. So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control. Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at. And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one, but I don't think it's uh reachable. That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something. Yeah, but only if they zap a lot, and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something. Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features. And older people uh want to spend uh more money. The company is about our uh th th their own fashion, their own style. Yeah, to k to keep it simple when you Sorry I thought about it, yes. Yeah, it's it's no it's not a It's what Paul says. You can choose blue or yellow or That's fa That's fancy. It's not uh I it's it's just uh the the Mm. And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off. So you don't have to search for your television or your code. Everywhere in the r Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons? We have to give our customers some extras. But only the numbers, one to twenty or something. Uh if i if i I didn't have information about that. It uh uh it have to work only when you use it. But uh uh for a user to to remember, if I press that button it goes to that channel. Yeah, or I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works. So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right. Um that's connecting to all the components. So the chip knows what button you pressed. And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb. So you have to indicate that it's Huh, that's a good idea. Yeah, but mm like when you push it n n Yeah. I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular. Okay, well, so we have s mm uh broad audience. Uh volume, channels, the the basic according to. But if you could make a new option, that you just have to press one button and you get on your No y Well it's It was just a thought. Is Just the channel um uh What I mean is uh Six seven eight or five. So you have that uh Yeah, the ten plus button. Just uh one one pressing, or quickly after each other. To just keep it simple and standard uh features. But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes. Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on. Uh using the standards, basic Um I think that we should stand out uh unique, being unique with the design. Well, maybe you can look at uh mobile phones. But maybe Well we don't have to make it red. No I don't think so, but Yeah, i it it will look different, and I think we need to find something else. Yeah, if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it, it's Yeah, i if you're in the dark, you can't see the remote. And also it's Okay, it shouldn't take much Uh I th I think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options. But we lose about ninety percent of those options. Um Well yeah, then we have to make some nice features. So Yeah, I tho I think that's not usable. Maybe just as an option, w like we discussed, like iPod. Um so yeah, it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly. The last point is quite an interesting So if we Yeah. Yeah, we should have the ten percent on the on the top, then you're you're So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus. But do we still need a two level remote control? It looks very cheap if you make it Oh, you just I dunno what happened. So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it? Or just a green one, because it's If you use it, it's green or the red, it's r green. You have to The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons. No, we have a recharger in it, so If we can still make that then But it's cool if it was green. So we can make the normal one also a normal light. We make uh make uh, we can make th th the new remote control very flashy. Do we, do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything? Um So yeah, you know what you have to do.", "The Project Manager announced that the remote should only control television, and that the marketing should be targeted towards ages 40 and above. The Marketing Expert presented the results of a lab study on users of remote controls, and showed that users want a fancier, less complicated remote that does not get lost easily. The group decided not to use speech recognition or an LCD screen to target the older demographic. The User Interface Designer discussed the button functions and how to make channel-changing easier. The group decided not to include programmable \"favorites\" buttons. The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of the device. The group discussed having the remote light up when used. He also stressed that the remote must be compatible with all television brands. The Project Manager corrected his target group announcement and announced that the target age group was actually ages 40 and below. The group again discussed the possibility of adding speech recognition and LCD screens to the design but decided that it was not feasible. The group decided to have the remote light up when used and is including teletext. The Marketing Expert was instructed to report on trendwatching.

Un unless you feel you need it t to okay okay. Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. And you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part. Not really Well we've done finance evaluation criteria, production evaluation. I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied oh, oh it's alright. And when you were talking about it I was just like you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things, 'cause I Yeah. Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration. Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time? Any other ideas for Um we still have time if there's any other input. And it comes yeah, I can change the vegetable. So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want. The it's trendy fruit, it's not just ordinary fruits. One side is curved and then the other side is curved. I imagine they're somewhere on the front. Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points, you know, all the way up to the top. Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable. Um, I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff. It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape. Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control. Well I think it's interesting how it all went together, like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap, and you have how people want it to be spongy, and It seems planned you know. Well they drop off if you like move too much. But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones. There's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting, like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company. And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know. I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings. We have to use a table, I'll show you that later, together to decide whether it meets the standards. I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. One five five two is thirteen, over four for now. Well the worst ones were three point one. So I think it's yeah those are the only two points. I think What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat But it's still too big I think, in your hand. You could do, although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say, like sorta like a joystick. I felt like my I dunno if it was just my role, but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had. But there's kinda it was kinda like okay, I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here.", "The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed the changeable fruit- and vegetable-shaped covers. They discussed the locator function that will be designed at a later time. The Project Manager discussed the final production cost for the device, which totaled 11.9 Euros. The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype. Each participant rated the prototype according to the original criteria for the project. The group discussed the areas in which the prototype did not meet these goals. The group felt that the changeable fruit and vegetable shapes were uncomfortable to hold. The group decided to make changeable covers in fruit colors and designs and to use one uniform shape. The group discussed their experience on the project. They felt they worked well together and were creative. They complained that the meeting-room materials were difficult to use, and some complained that there was not enough information provided to them. The Project Manager instructed all participants to write a final report at the end of the meeting. "], ["Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes. This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um Sorry about this.. And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of, um, can we uh outsource these from elsewhere, um will we have to construct any items ourselves? Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the the point being made. Well, um I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway. You always have to bring out new designs, so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway. Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that. Um, looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber. Was there anything in your research Mm-hmm. I think we've come up I think we've covered everything we need to here. Um I think we've decided on what, you know, decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such, so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting. Um The user interface design, They're kind of it looks they're the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there, whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate, do you think? Um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out, uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar. That one might have to be based on The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice, easy minimal design, normally. I I'm not sure, but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive. We don't know unless it would make sense to. We've already had the five minute warning, so. Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay. Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used. We should probably just use conventional batteries. Uh one is a flat one, and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved. Well for a curved, well I was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand. And maybe um an okay button around here, so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily. It probably means this is probably double curved. Um which obviously it looks better than the single curve, but uh you can't have it in titanium, which is uh a nice material. Um if you want the buttons to be oh yeah, if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber, then you have these rubber buttons as well. Um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_. The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material, not just normal rubber. So uh to gather my research, two basic methods. Technology technical technologically innovative. So like the interface is really important. People want it I is it has to be cooler than easy to use, you know, if it has the newest features, even if it's difficult to use, prefer it to have the newest features. So we have the choice between rubber and plastic. Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative, obviously. And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control. So um if we want something strong and sturdy, I say stay with plastic or titanium, but if we go with spongy, we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want, it doesn't matter, it's spongy material, it's not gonna break, you know. Yeah, you see I don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others. Now I'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh and the white board 'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time. Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick, two function buttons and the L_C_D_, just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum. Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design, um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people. Um okay on to on to the next uh to the next slide. Yeah, 'kay basically um I can add pretty pictures to this. Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users. And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes. Yeah, actually if you've got a lot of channels, the number keypad can be quite annoying as well, becau it's you know if you're trying to remember what uh, you know, what number's the discovery channel or whatever. So that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that. Um well I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it, um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made, I would say. and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose.", "The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer presented options for batteries, materials and shapes to use for the case, buttons, and chips. The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for an ergonomic remote which conforms to the shape and movements of the human hand, as well as an option in which users could connect their remotes to computers in order to download program settings. The marketing expert discussed findings from trendwatching reports, which indicated a need for products which look fancy, are technologically innovative, are easy to use, have a fruit and vegetable theme, and are spongy. The team then discussed what materials and components to use, the color of the remote, and programming options for the remote. "], ["Uh first of all I'll start with the costs, because that's going to influence our design. Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things. Um Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved? Yeah if you lose the the Back, the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows, and the Menu button. I just m I don't I think Uh yeah it's I think it's grey, regular. Just a minute.. Yeah, this the last phase of course, so Hmm. But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense, because we had to drop it. Uh Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three. I just couldn't Um, just one minute.. So. Uh not on that, but So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen. Yeah.. Yes.. Well Um now you probably have to recalibrate. You can just if you ma finish my presentation please. Or are there uh Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed, and and so forth. No that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look. So Yeah, b but I think the battery option. So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button. So we have to to make it s uh more uh It has to be Could drop the speech recognition. Just put a special special colour of the buttons, or something. Ah i And that you only have to control one button. That's why it's uh Just count it to Yeah. It doesn't look like uh Uh it it's it's not Yeah. Maybe that's why it's it's not working, because it's more Yeah. Yeah, can we t can we get to that i Oh it's not working anymore. I think the PowerPoint is is too limited. Yeah just for text, for text it's uh it's okay. Let let let me see what's more what's more popular. And then when you in the menu S so so you activate the menu. And then for the menu, um you can have a button that activates menu. Click on it again, selects features, scroll, adjust it. Then you only need one button to move back. And in that menu, scroll, click, one step back. Those five which I mentioned, and then menu, and then Yeah. Yeah well we need the advanced Instead of r Yeah but but that's not our market. Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display? Then then then you should do everything in the menu. There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing. Um Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user. So that's very true, I guess, for our case. I don't think it's easy to use, or not so. So I think a two is more appropriate than Yeah. Word document, the Yeah we have to count them. I think you can just count them by a Um let's move over. That's uh three uh Or le less than a three. This something what's projection from behind, I guess. So The process, I mean, the interaction between us became better and better I guess. Mm uh I think in in essence the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard. I mean uh uh I've made yeah, uh I've made several notes just to test it, and and just put the pen in into it, and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly. But the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. Well, it It's use especially useful, I guess, to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff. So we'll just have to use it for everything. And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen, and select a channel, click Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then. If you if you go to If you go to our uh view, like you if you are in the sound system there, uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance, this is just uh an example, y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example. So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button. Which That's even Yeah, if you if you go to eight I don't know how to Yeah, we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display. I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on. 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen. But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though. Well, we have extended menus, on the on the L_C_D_ screen. E exactly just like a m mobile.. Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something, if When it's on, yeah, it's turned on, It automatically has the the programme and the volume function, but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some Of you Or you double click it. Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick. We still have the fruit and vegetable print. But only on the on the outside, not on the button. Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve. I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape, that would give it something young and fresh. 'Cause you're putting everything Most votes count. And the the casing, hard plastic also lasts forever. Yeah the lower the The lower the score the better, right? Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours? Yeah there is some kind of projection I think. So i if I change this, it will go there, if I change that, will go there. And the third time yeah, I mean Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.", "The project manager decided to start by looking at costs instead of the prototype presentation because the original design was too expensive and had to be changed. The group discussed which features should be dropped. The group decided that the LCD screen was integral to their design, but dropped the speech recognition. They decided to drop all the buttons in favour of an integrated scroll push-button, and to use a hand dynamo instead of kinetic energy as a power source. The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation, based on the new design. The group were satisfied with the overall score of 3.1. The industrial designer and user interface designer worked on a drawing of the new design, while the project manager and marketing manager worked on the final report. The project manager led an evaluation of the project process. The group thought that they worked well together, especially after the first meeting. They were happy with the room for creativity, but thought they were limited by the budget. They preferred the digital pens to the SMARTboard.  They had mixed feelings about using PowerPoint. "], ["I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer. I don't yeah I mean it but like I mean just I mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate, it can light up and make noise and I dunno. I dunno, it seems like though that that would be hard, 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and Yeah so we the project is now couches and remote controls. Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah. What effect should the thing ha should it have, okay. Well I had the cat as well, but uh I've got a spare one. I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment, and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals. Um, a lot, two two two million, two mi no, more f four million. I don't think you need a But definitely not well I don't know. Good feel, tact tactile, good tactile feel, maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot. I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer. I think the pen is running out of Two million. Actually I haven't thought of anything yet. So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant, strong and furry. Um, I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show. So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient, practical, nice remote control. You know like a portable phone has a base, like just to have a home for it. Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose, or does that not factor in? I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w Yeah, yeah.", "The group introduced themselves to each other. The Project Manager discussed the goals for the project and gave an agenda for the project as a whole. The group practiced using the meeting-room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard. The Project Manager presented the projected profit and price point. The group discussed their experiences with remote controls. They complained that remotes got lost too easily, and suggested using a locator function. They also complained that remotes had too many buttons, and suggested incorporating a screen to simplify the interface but retain all of the functions. They also suggested making the remote water-resistant and including a clip. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to research the working design and components, the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions, and the Marketing Expert to research user requirements. "], ["No y no no no, the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard, extremely hard wood, but there are some very pretty woods out there. They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic, so, and chew 'em up. It's almost like, Houston, we have a product here. Okay, I also have a f very simple presentation, because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want. I also have uh copied a different type of remote. The second one, there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it, which makes it fairly hard to read, uh very hard to use. The first one, I see that they put in a display. Maybe the display also makes it easier to use, because sometimes when you're looking for buttons, maybe if you see a display Okay Because I've seen mostly the standard ones, yeah. We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market. Where w Where it would be manufactured is is another step. We're here to design, come up with a nice product. No no p spec It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it. So uh, if you could open the PowerPoint presentation. Right here, is that little that one, yes please. So um for the case, um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design. Course, you know, I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable, but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore, so then we were thinking about um rubber, but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's uh goes with the board. And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print, so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should, you know, use some of uh some really exotic woods, like um, you know uh, well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods. I'm not sure, how do I Oh, I know, let's see. And you could you could sell oils with it, to take care of it. Yeah, they do it with other materials as well, yeah. So, have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that, but Sure. And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control. Yeah, so it's really molded to to your specific But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote. And finally in this meeting we have to decide and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design So we have forty minutes, I think it's uh little bit uh low, but I I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the the functional team, to the Christine, okay, to discuss about uh the components concept. And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple, so Yeah. Yeah, so uh what we'll do is, uh, we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra, in case we go for the display. Then they can show you how it looks like, and then we can uh submit to the I will submit to the management.", "The Industrial Designer gave her components concept presentation, which presented the components that will be used and how they will be integrated into the functional design. She announced that their only choice for casing material was wood, so she suggested an idea of having customizable wood cases. The User Interface Designer gave her presentation on the user interface concept for the product, and gave a basic layout of the remote's key functions. The Marketing Expert presented the marketing concept and discussed including a display to facilitate use. The group discussed the unique, custom design of the remote, and quickly talked about finding a manufacturer that could make the custom cases cheaply that still paid fair wages. The group also discussed whether or not to incorporate the display into the design, and decided to wait until the cost of adding that feature was known before adding it to the design. The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer were instructed to begin building a prototype, and the Marketing Expert was instructed to work on the marketing strategy as well as research the cost of the display component. "], ["Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder, but Is it unlocked? So That's in the presentation, so Uh below I believe. It's open already so you can use to find yours. Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something. Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty, but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well. And we have to decide on the functions, and on the, let's see what was it, uh the target group. Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things For the menu. Channel up and down, and the control of the advanced options. Uh, so contrast, bright, uh And the others were in your presentation right? So you You have an additional processor and and software part. Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek? Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer. And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was, as I believe. But I think the communication with the television is difficult. So but Um The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function I put them on the. I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so Make me proud. alt delete.. So it doesn't draw the attention away. Um Well uh some research has be done uh has been done. Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control. The findings were um, well you can see them for yourself. Um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users. Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay. Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash, and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future. Well we got an update for the for the audience. Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options, you can put that in the screen. So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen, uh with a clear menu. Yeah well it yeah it didn't it didn't say what they want to do with the screen. Yeah searching for channels, programming them. Yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it. Yeah like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals? I most people are right-handed so maybe left-handed special addition, but okay. Um then you could put a screen, like on a mobile phone, also on top I guess. I mean i That's not sure but it's Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me. I mean this is basically numbers, volume, uh channel up and down. Yeah con contrast is Yeah okay, colour and brightness. Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something, which w displays all the all the values, all the channels which are possible. So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily. And and just put it under the screen, the screen Yeah. That that just to to activate the screen. So And then with these buttons, woa, y you navigate. I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need. Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information. So uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting. And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually. The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions. Yeah definitely.. And might be easier huh? If you Yeah treble, middl middle, bass or something. Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things. He only has to figure out how it has to look. Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department. The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is, sorry sorry, uh is uh if you're pressing up and down, you can easily press the okay once you, when you're not already at your choice. We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button. Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions. Um the one group for the for the display, and one group for the basic functions, and Yeah okay but we we have a m yeah but maybe that's that's not uh yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control, you can press the the menu button, and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display. Okay so that that's not uh Yeah that Those are multifunctional. Yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh yeah m a multifunctional navigation button. But do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now? Because I I've everything in my head now so Okay. And uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered.. It's it's just my own map so I put everything into the But you got some extra information uh Okay.", "The marketing expert reported on research which shows that users think most remotes are ugly, easily lost and bad for RSI. Audio settings are rarely used, and the power, channel and volume buttons are used most often. The remote should be user-friendly and have a good look and feel. The marketing expert and project manager described the new requirements that the target group is users under 40, the remote should not include teletext, should be only for TV, and should feature the corporate logo. The user interface designer showed examples of two contrasting remotes, recommending that they should use the best features of both. The group decided to use an LCD screen and speech recognition. The industrial designer described how a remote works, and explained that his presentation was incomplete because he had not received the necessary information in time. The group discussed what functions to include and the layout of the remote, and the marketing expert drew a possible design on the board. They decided to have buttons for the basic functions and make the advanced functions accessible through the screen. They also discussed what buttons would be needed to navigate the menu on the LCD screen. "], ["Where are are all the other presentations? So um the developments I will address them oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours. And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use. Uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material. Yeah I was thinking of that also, with with a with a uh arrow. So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu. So s Yeah there's only in in this dimension. Or But then the side view can be straight. So okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open. Yeah but but that's optional for later I guess. I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like? And then uh Oh Yeah with some some yellow banana Like. That would be a nice uh nice device I guess. So just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that. No uh But maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour right? And if the background is very dark blue Yeah? Should they be white or black or Uh Yeah but it's pretty fresh, on the other side. I kn I know what's gonna happen in in yeah so I've a basic idea. Maybe you should draw it very large like this. So then it's like this, or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this. But we still keep the flipping mechanism. Uh 'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design, that's it.. I did get a bit more done than the last time, 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there, and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint, so it takes me forever to get something done with it. And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design. Uh we have a hand dynamo, which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt. Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing, if you shake it. Single curved, which means that it has uh curves in one dimension. I always chuck my uh remote control around, so Yeah y exactly. S see this is the the the standard traditional type, where the form uh yeah serves the function, you know. Not only like this but it has to be exactly. And It ha Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually, 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours, and with a lot of shape. And Yeah, and the and the rubber, it it will look cheap always, you know, with the There is mobile phones, in which you can change the colour also of the lights. Just give me the thing that it's inside there maybe I'm too old for this stuff. And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette, where you have the shape for your thumb. Well this is really your decision but Yeah. So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first. Give it I would give it a female shape but uh yeah. I mean Yeah but we have hardware inside, which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape. And also the screen, you cannot mould it. So this is gonna be from the uh from yeah yeah. Yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah. No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and So okay. Uh we have this very uh basic uh trendy design. And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options. A little bit I think but not not everything w Okay. Uh with a speech display uh yeah, sound, everything you you noted in your uh minutes. Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh yeah. But it has also to it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people. Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children. If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour, then it's just a neutral colour, also for the for the more uh yeah for the people. That's how we are going to make it uh more trendy. Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about? And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface. Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly. Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit. But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons? Yeah you are going to design it so.. Yeah just testing. You can look at the final report, 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such, so I'm trying to write it down between everything else. But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay. So we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy. But I don't know if it's worth the effort. But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light. Uh partly but you have to print on the number. Next thirty minutes to design something so And the You will do the evaluation. Five minutes left before the meeting ends. I don't see any power cables here so 'Kay.", "The marketing expert talked about trendwatching and explained that the current trends are for fruit and vegetable themed products and products with a spongy texture. For users, the three most important aspects of a remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, and ease of use. The industrial designer talked about the options for energy source, case shape and material, and internal components. The group decided on using kinetic energy, and a double-curved rubber case. The user interface designer talked about speech recognition and what functions will be controlled through buttons or the lcd screen menu. The project manager ran through the group's decisions so far and led a discussion of their remaining options, including the colour of the case and buttons, and whether the remote should flip open or not. "], ["You have to put it exactly on the on the yeah. And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah, you know what it is, it's exactly how it looks and whatever. And you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map. So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read. So it's not that cool as I th thought it would be. Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control? You can put games on your remote control. Yeah, how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger? So you know what you have to what you have to do? Yeah, no maybe not not uh, that's not a f that's something for for for yeah. Uh I also forgot my mouse, but I don't need my mouse, I think. Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word. Yeah, my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control? Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television, we sell it uh apart. Um I think it must be a very good control, so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room, the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality. Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh Um Ma maybe a home station. Uh I I set something on paper already, size, looks, uh usable, uh the buttons on usable places, uh the the on off button must be on top, uh it has to lay good in the hand, you you have to uh Yeah, I don't I don't know I don't know if we You can make it very special, to create our own um looks, but it's very hard to Nah. Yeah, it's also about strength and uh for everything uh. Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem. I think Yeah, something uh on top, just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often. Yeah b I wanted No you can make an uh manual in it. But that's Yeah, I think it's much uh too expensive. So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think, so you can do something unique with that. it was suggested that the remote could feature the folding-open design to hide complicated functions on the inside of the device.@highlightThe Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification and to research which devices the remote will control.", "The Project Manager introduced himself and the project to the group. He presented an agenda for the rest of the project. The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room materials by drawing on the board. The Project Manager discussed the projected price point, profit aim, and production cost for the project. The group discussed their initial ideas about the product design. They decided to make the remote a universal remote. They discussed the form of the device; it was suggested that the device could have a folding-open design or a touch-screen interface. They discussed energy source options and could not decide between using standard batteries or a recharging stand. They also discussed how to make the remote look more unique; it was suggested that the remote could feature the folding-open design to hide complicated functions on the inside of the device. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification and to research which devices the remote will control. "], ["So we're going to talk about the conceptual model. People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones. Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control. But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros. Yeah, but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it. We still want to have a recharger, don't we? Because we don't have time for that to to put it in. But maybe the form has to be a bit different. And we need a plastic case, with a scroll wheel. Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this. If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than Nah okay. What did What else we have to discuss about? So we have to make a decision, what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have. Maybe the ones we are going to draw there. So we make it a bit like m that one probably. But it doesn't say anything about it, does it? Okay, we just put it in, because it's a good feature. It uh is twice important as the following. But um this is the second uh important uh aspect, and I think uh we must use some of the new technology, to be uh innovative. Yeah, it's something that uh it stand there. Uh maybe an extraordinary shape, like a sponge. Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative. But how uh we we're gonna make many of those. It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape. Uh i Yeah, but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control? Mm Uh but we have to do something about the trend. And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two. Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project. Yeah, we can b It c it could be just just a square, just a packet. Just just more like this and not uh a square. We have to be original and uh technological innovative. We started with information about the cost was now th And how much is the chip? I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials. Oh I got an email uh And it says uh the chip can be uh simple, regular or advanced. Yeah, I've I've got something of that uh too. But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons, like one two three. Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time. If you aim at a young public, you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green, blue, red. Yeah, but mm is uh has round corners I think. And um sports and gaming device style characteristics. The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient. Yeah, but we can still make it transparent. I don't know what it is, but it should be there I think. I don't know what they do or Nah, but they just said we need it. But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well. Yeah, I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff. I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls. I don't find it very usable, but it's Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well. So the focus gets on these parts and not on there. To use So if you put in uh speech recognition, you need so more uh many more buttons. You can Just like a mobile phone, you can make um different fronts on it. That was the idea, or just uh release one. Uh depends on the colour of the Yeah, that's true. 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well. Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board. I I think it's It's it's obvious, I think. No, you have uh It is Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic. You have to look at that image of the iPod. Which w Here you see one that's very round. I've uh I had a lot of picture of old ones. But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here what the old ones look like. More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player. Well, maybe we can just open images there, and I'll paint and paint. This is a very small electronic unit, will give a standard answer after it recognise a question. Because uh So it works like uh good morning remote control, and then the remote control says good morning.", "The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. The Marketing Expert gave a trendwatching report. He found that a fancy look and feel was most important for users. He also discussed the trend towards spongy materials. The group discussed the cost of adding speech recognition, the LCD screen, and the advanced chip. The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the interface with the group. They discussed the placement and design of the buttons and decided to use scroll wheels for volume. The Industrial Designer advised that flashy colors and rounded shapes be used. The group discussed how to incorporate the logo and including changeable faces. They discussed materials for the buttons and the backlight. The group decided to use rechargeable batteries and a stand, to use plastic for the casing and buttons, and to not include an LCD screen. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to draw the prototype at the next meeting, and the User Interface Designer was instructed to finalize the button placement. The group finalized the look of the product, and eventually decided to incorporate speech recognition and an advanced chip. "], ["'Kay so we'll try to zip through this, since we're short on time. It's the little blue w it's the one th yeah. And if if you consider our budget, it probably if you consider our budget, to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey. So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can right. So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals. I mean I guess one takes care of the other, like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's Yeah. So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them, yeah you you did um, they're I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing, and the other looked like just television. So we definitely want a power button and numbers. Or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down. So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next But we'll hold off on that 'cause But s yeah uh. Um, yeah, let's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up. The other ones are the settings, and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour, and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings, and then, just one, and then from there go on to the audio on the screen, either on the remote or on the television. Um, about the screen, and speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that. How it looks or the the buzzer you mean, yeah, for sure, yeah. Yeah, you can Yeah, click o actually click on to have Yeah. But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here, I'm pretty sure Yeah. Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass. Could you just plug it back into hers because she had oh. Does it have like capacity to change the channels? Um does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_? Like in terms of how it looks, or like what it does? Just 'cause I wouldn't I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button. That sort of like joystick flat touch thing, yeah. So, I know I'm not c really clear on what Yeah, yeah. The cable might be a little loose or something. And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works. Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh, battery for the energy source, that way you wouldn't have to plug it in, um a button pad for input, um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff, I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_, that's just sort of standard, um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver. Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably. Um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me, I think that's what the phone has, I mean when you need to find your phone, you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever.", "The Marketing Expert gave a presentation about user requirements as shown through a usability study and demonstrated that only a small number of functions on a remote were used with frequency. She suggested focusing the interface design on the most frequently used functions. The User Interface Designer presented some questions that should be considered in making the device user-friendly and displayed two existing remote controls for comparison. The Industrial Designer discussed the necessary internal components and how they operated together, and presented her preferences for the type of each component to be used. The Project Manager gave the group several new requirements for the project. The group discussed several product features and decided that the remote will feature a locator function and will not feature speech recognition. The group discussed whether or not the remote should control multiple devices. They discussed important button functions to include and increasing usability by incorporating a scroll wheel in the design. The Project Manager instructed the other participants to fill out a questionnaire and to work on their individual presentations for the next meeting. "], ["Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well. Yeah, we're gonna use the advanced chip then. I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. So uh the best place, the best reach place Um on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. Well and um the backlight thing, the thing that lights up. Um Uh i the the speech functions buttons. That's Yeah well we don't have any uh Hmm? S Just uh like Um I think it's best if we do. I dunno if Yeah, I think as well, but Uh yeah. Yeah, in thi the the remote control in the the chip. Well I think we do If it's really uh, if you can if you can get the iPod look, then it's beautiful, I think. Well we have changeable fronts, so So Yeah. It it's At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls. You can different front uh This is a a power indicator. Yeah, th the speaker is very small as well, right? Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with, if it worked really well. Then It's a difficult choice, either here or there. Yeah, but I think Oh no you made another mistake. Okay, there is one uh function I use uh daily, and it's not on the basic functions. And so y you keep you keep one, you have one left. If we have enough place, uh then we can do that. Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages. Because um if you use it a couple of years, some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away, are uh And maybe we can write the numbers below or above? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons? Yeah, and i The most time Yeah, with rubber buttons. And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control. Because because I think I think the scroll wheel, uh it's very handy, but the first time you get this thing in your hands, it's not to use the scroll wheel. 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use. Uh I only saw it in a telephone, not in an remote control. Yeah, different fronts for a remote control, I think that's new too. So we have a pretty new uh It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something. Tha tha that No, we we we searched for uh um a young group, audience, beneath f forty. Call That's Yeah, but it No, we need that. For for for To gather, or to uh work together, uh or new ideas for No, for the prototype. Yeah, and Or are we making a slide open, like underneath? Yeah, s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions. Uh colour changeable, and also transparent. Well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad. So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function. Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity then there we probably have been creative. Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. Just make make a Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something. Or we just make it three buttons, all the colours on it. Yeah, but you have to search every time again. But it's still the television that has to do that. No, it's only on the number, behind the numbers and uh That as well, yeah. Yeah for a Uh for a f There are no games on it, that's that's It's not a one, it's a two again. And new features, so we give it a two or also again a one? No, I think i if you have games on it, then then you give you have a one. Yeah, there are some that they didn't mention, because recharge is not on the list. Special colour, you can skip this one, because it's all quite normal. So you can put a recharger in it as well. So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together. It's the same for the presenta for the presentations.", "The project manager presented the agenda and the minutes from the previous meeting. The group discussed speech recognition , whether the remote should slide open or fold open, and what type of chip they should use. The designers presented the prototype, which resembles an ipod in appearance, and is made of transparent coloured plastic. The colours will be changeable. The remote has both buttons and a scroll wheel. The number buttons have a back-light. The group discussed adding extra buttons/functions. The prototype was evaluated and received an average overall score of 1.8. The project manager went through the finances, and the total cost came to 12.3 euros, although this did not include the cost of the recharger, which was not on the price list. The group evaluated the project process, and were generally pleased with their creativity and teamwork, but were unsatisfied with the equipment. "], ["Right, my name's Adam Duguid, we're here because of real reaction, um, we have in the group Um, yeah, go for it mate. So, the reason we're here, we're gonna design a new remote control, as you probably all know. The very broad overview is original, trendy, and user-friendly. We're gonna have the three kay phases, as you've probably already been told, the functional, architectural, and the detailed design. Ebenezer, you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal? Tarik, would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry? Yep, the, it's just across there, that's it. Okay, well we're beginning to run out of time now, so, we've got a couple of ideas, we can we'll have to work fast, um, alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting, so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality, um, how the user interface might work, that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it, you have to have a lot of response back, or at least some kind. That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily. I will make this quick, since we don't have much time. First point, begins with an E_, same like Ebenezer. Also, elephants have a very good memory, much like myself, and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria, but I think I used to have a pet elephant. Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design. And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket. For instance, um let's say oh oh um, or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well, um Mm-hmm.", "The team members introduced themselves to each other by name and by their roles in the project. The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed why they liked the animal. The project manager discussed the project finances and selling prices. The team then discussed various features to consider in producing the remote such as gaming options, an LCD screen, and combining functionality so as to control multiple devices. "], ["Okay uh Agnes, you can help me for the slide when okay. I hope uh you have a fresh head and a fresh time. How t now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting. Then uh I'm going to talk about uh the project management, what I'm going to do, and uh, of course, I'm doing the project management and secretary both, okay, to take the minutes of the meeting. Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded, okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology. And the second one is about uh the remote control. Okay, so if you can add the feature, okay, for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay, with unbreakable, okay, I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product, if I'm not wrong. Uh let me go quickly, maybe if I can go back. Okay, and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side. And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion. Do you think you can make it or uh What do you think about uh the design, uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition? And uh we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop, apart from uh what today. Yes, okay I don't mind to convince the the management, okay. So not really this one we are talk ab Yep. Uh from her side, I don't think uh there's too many more questions. Twenty-five Euros, uh that's that's a preson reasonable price. Obviously, we can't make a remote into a computer, but maybe simple commands. But, price obviously we have to talk about. Because it has to be something totally different, has to be total totally new. No, I just wondering whether that you had any sort of Yeah. It's not just, you know, noises like something hitting. So, basically, the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products. So, in our case, existing remote controls. Um and then what the remote control should look like, obviously, once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are. So, I would be inclined to go sort of towards this, in terms of design, rather than this. So uh, I also, since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product, thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those, and, as I said in the first meeting, um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction, especially in the the uh the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance, and it is reliable, and so forth. I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth, so, I guess this guy Zenith uh created the Flashmatic, which I kinda like the idea, 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the T_V_ on and off, that might be interesting. And um it would uh y you'd you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off, you could use it for something else. I don't know why um we were asked to do this. And uh, course I never wanna replace the battery. But um anyway, um I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life. the Industrial Designer, the components concept.", "The Project Manager gave new requirements for the product: the remote will not include a teletext function, will only be used for television, and must show the corporate image. The Industrial Designer presented  possible components to consider. The group then discussed hard materials to include in the design. The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan and showed that there is a demand for remotes featuring voice recognition and other capabilities; the group discussed how it could be integrated into the functional design. The Project Manager offered to help the Industrial Designer find companies to provide help in integrating this component. The designers expressed that they needed more information from the board on their expectations for the product. The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on product design from the user's perspective and emphasized simplicity in design. She also suggested that the group make a decision on which features to include in the final product design, but the group decided to postpone it. The designers were given their assignments: the Marketing Expert will present the marketing concept; the User Interface Designer, the user interface concept; the Industrial Designer, the components concept.
