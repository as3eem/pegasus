[["Yeah, that's probably a better one, to discuss it straight away. So I don't think it would effect our circuit board. And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it. Actually I don't think it really says anything about the cost, but it says that it's already in the coffee machines, so like it's already kind of Um. There wasn't much more to say about that, just rambling. Right well that's something that we can be aware of. Um yeah I think um I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it. The spongy feel, or did we think that that might go as a trend? But um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there. And the rubber push buttons, rubber case. Yeah and and the voice recognition, we can use that can't we, just to find it. I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires, maybe before we m make a decision. Just Just just for the call and find thing. Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device, so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it. I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching. So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends. And second, there should be some technological innovation. I presume it must have been not not spongy last year. I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into. The trend was different last year apparently. But I don't know whether the trend will change. Apple apple a a qu Quite a big one, as well. I think we all have a presentation again, so if we go through those and then um. Um basically the uh for the Um I'll back actually. We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate. Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas. Um there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down, which may be for the volume. Um moving on to the printed s Um that's on the next I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost, that that related to the actual buttons, but it does affect the printed circuit board. Basically for the circuit board which is the middle, it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote. There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense. Um and for the circuit board, again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote. Uh but I don't know, so that is something I'll have to look into. Um that's a that's a decision for all of us. Also the display's for something else which we decided against. The um it was basically what we said before, the idea that you record in a set message, and then it picks up that message um and replies to you. Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than Um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board. It's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah. ' I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market, maybe not, but Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest? So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step, but maybe I dunno for ours, maybe we should Yeah. Well I dunno I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment, but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are, maybe I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends. to something which is maybe more universal. Um oh no no no sorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons. But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production, whether that would just increase the costs, make it more complicated. Yeah, less likely to So then th th that would Yeah. So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply? And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out. So the speech recognition was Are we going for speech recognition? Yeah, I've found that try and get it back. Uh the fi Yeah, the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote. 'Cause it was sixteen buttons, wasn't it that were Okay. That means you're constantly changing your production schedule, and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else, so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest. So you're talking there about uh changing changing the casing. I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever.", "The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting. The Industrial Designer discussed options for each of the internal components. He showed that the size of the chip was dependent on the type and number of additional features used. The group discussed incorporating speech recognition and other functions to be able to decide on chip size. They decided that using speech recognition for the locator function only would allow them to use a simple chip. The User Interface Designer presented several existing products. She presented a specialized children's remote; the group decided to focus on a basic remote that would appeal to a wide market. She expressed that buttons are often ambiguously shaped and that their remote must have an easy-to-use interface. The Marketing Expert presented trends in the remote control market and the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion. The group discussed ways to incorporate these trends. They decided to make the standby button shaped like an apple, to use a rubber case and buttons, and to use a single-curved shape. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype. "], ["In this meeting we will discuss our final design. And this uh design, detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design, the usability interface design, and we will do the product evaluation. We'll have the prototype presentation first. But first um we will do the this is prototype presentation. But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons. Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end. Yeah but th it's not stated in this files. If you make this Looks a bit like uh a cross. But I think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button. Don't you think we can, if we can count this as v as one button, and integrate th uh these buttons in three, then we save a lot of money as well. Then you will Or maybe you can um scroll. But it would definitely crop cost, a lot. Because it saves it saves a lot of money. Yeah, we can leave the teletext in if we want. So we can decrease this one to four buttons. So people will use it more, and especially for the help functions, it will be good if we have scroll bar, scroll button. Before we went on to the to the whole design. No, but I think I think the most That's right. And it's uh it's b uh less frightening, I think. What it costs under twelve and a half Euros? So we've got twenty cents for our docking station, huh? They are ugly, not very functional, and getting lost. Also, you two of you with the uh last phase? And then it mediates the score, and you can get one Yeah. Uh and I think you can compensate that as well. You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers. So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market. I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire. Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons. And you But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel. We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or Can't uh go um Nay. Uh, wi with n Oh, with uh attractive uh o options. Uh We have to test it s But Uh, yeah, true. And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it. My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message. Um Well, since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier, more easy, maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little. Yeah, but Well, think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button, go to page eight eight eight, and teletext disappears. Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero. This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell. And are the those functions that are there, are they useful? If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it? And So we're supposed to evaluate it right now. I think so, with our L_C_D_ screen, docking station, scroll-buttons. These are seven factors times seven is forty something. And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own.", "In the detailed design meeting the team created a prototype. Along with buttons for numbers, channel selector, volume, mute, on-off, teletext, and subtitles, the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information. One rechargable battery, single-curve form and plastic case, brought the total cost to 17 Euros. To reduce this cost, it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel. The remaining buttons were one for channel selection, one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel), teletext, on-off and the help button. A suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval. All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype. It was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (6), technological innovation (4), functionality (7), consideration of the target group (3). The remote was also recognisable as a fashionable Real Reaction product. The project process was deemed well-structured, although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage. Teamword and leadership were good, but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints. "], ["Uh now we're going um into the functional design. And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include. So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation. I think it's going to Uh it's not too much. Um that's because uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big, if we wanna have it uh for more functions. Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext, because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past. And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control. Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well. Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons. So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control, and the other way round. But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market, that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it. 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important. Um so I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage. Um Functionality should be few buttons, you said. Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have? Should be fancy to, fancy design, easy to learn. I think that's a good idea as well, because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one. Okay I've got a presentation about the working design. It gots conductive disks for every button. And besides that it's um If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt. They're not used to using scroll buttons. Y i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen, 'cause it's uh Well I don't think they have different television sets uh in uh every country. F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly. Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control. That uh audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons. Which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance. I think we should make a remote for the future. And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five. So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design. Besides of course that the remote must look very nice. Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons. 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust. But up till forty five it remains feasible. So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it. Besides that, I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small. because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control. I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext. But I mean it, if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway. Think if you're gonna include teletext you do. That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_. Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control. And with uh the little screen in it, which explains the buttons. I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control. Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it, Um about uh interface but uh Uh Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control. Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that. So um Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um Uh this the remote control uh and uh you got here the general functions, uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh I dunno um And um here you've got a s kind of a display. S um it's uh not uh in colour or something.", "The project manager stated the agenda and the marketing expert discussed what functions are most relevant on a remote, what the target demographic is, and what his vision for the appearance of the remote is. The marketing expert also brought up the idea to include a docking station to prevent the remote from getting lost and the idea to include an LCD screen. The user interface designer pushed for a user-friendly interface with large buttons, a display function, a touchscreen, and the capability of controlling different devices. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by. The team then discussed teletext, the target demographic, the buttons the remote should have, the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly, an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost, LCD screens, and language options. "], ["You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing. I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one. And and it, yeah, when it died we didn't get a new one or something. Than on the, with Yeah, I m I mean like uh like on here, drawing drawing uh. Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels. Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit. Um this exercise, um did the company board tell you to do it, or uh did you just make it up yourself? Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive, uh small, fairly cheap. Ju just uh make some mock-ups, some some general ideas. And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be. Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control. So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme. Well, I don't uh gonna explain it all, because I think you know uh how it works. So uh if you have uh drawn something, save it. Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal, and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal. Uh important is that we use different colours, and uh different pen widths. Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal? So, um You must p p uh push a little uh Good. Better to draw with a with But what is he uh? Finishing touch and then we're going further. So uh from my point of view, I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech, high definition, uh ultra modern uh kinda remote, for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro. Um So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things. What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature. What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others. Oh, in case you want it This is a dead kind of fly. Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions. Uh Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do. Some basic things we co we want to going to do. But if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose, that's a Why? the Marketing Expert discussed usability features, such as the ability to control multiple devices and an LCD screen, to make the product unique.@highlightThe Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the working design and the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions.@highlightThe group discussed the timing of when they would make decisions on the features discussed.", "The participants introduced themselves and their roles to each other. The Project Manager introduced the aim of the project and gave a brief agenda for the entire project. He then introduced and explained how to use the meeting-room materials. The group acquainted themselves with the materials by drawing on the smartboard. The Project Manager presented the project budget and explained that the device would not be made very high-tech due to the small budget. He explained that the device would be sold internationally. The group discussed their initial ideas of features to include in the design; the Marketing Expert discussed usability features, such as the ability to control multiple devices and an LCD screen, to make the product unique. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the working design and the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions. The group discussed the timing of when they would make decisions on the features discussed. "], ["Can't say I paid much attention to it, but Oh yeah. Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer. And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all. But that would be really good if we could do that. Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it. So you can see how much is left in the battery. But maybe just a little LED, I don't know. You can see there are a few cameras here. Well I don't know if you've noticed, but uh we're working for Real Reaction. I dunno it's not a lot of work, but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down, just write it down. Uh as you can see uh it's the opening, aquaintance tool training. Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control. We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look. He's also uh That's about the new remote control. The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design, uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design. We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here, so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first. It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of. We've got our shared folder, uh project project what was it? You can switch between the different drawings. And then we're going to try out the white board. You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child. Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow. Um as you can see, we um for our remote control, a selling price is uh twenty five Euros. And we can all work uh on our own projects.", "The project manager introduced himself to the team and then acquainted the team with the audio and video equipment in the meeting room. The project manager briefly described the company the team works for and discussed the corporate website. The project manager then described the upcoming project and the roles of each team member. The project manager introduced the smart boards to the team and led the team members in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and described why they liked the animal. The project manager briefed the team on the project budget and selling prices for the remote they are to create and led them in a discussion on their experiences with remote controls and what features they would like to include in their product. "], ["Right, okay um, this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place. Okay, um I'll go over what we decided last meeting, um, we decided upon a universal control, one handset for all, T_V_, video equipment. Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like. Um want it to look uncluttered, undaunting to the customer. Um, three presentations, I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first? Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset. Now with the baby boomers, the older generations are actually larger, they have a greater population than us young people, but I don't think we're focusing on that, I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um, business kind of class type people. You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway. Yes, which it is cheaper in the long run as well. 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway. Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different. Or you could do um different, like you get with mobile phones, different fascias. So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and Yeah. Um it could be it c It yes, it could be uh adv advertisement feature, um rather than design feature, you know, drawing attention to that. What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design? But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside really. And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do. Alright okay, and yeah, that's that's what I came up with there, so if you wanna Ooh. Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same. I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I? Thank you, just pull it closer a little bit. Um, current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall. So again there's power implications there. Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. Um, um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury. Um, that trend reverses in the older age groups. Mm-hmm, so can we not programme a video with this remote control? Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons, I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video, fast-forwarding, so on and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare. So I don't know if that's something we need to look at. Do we have to initially um, you know looking at the findings here, focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later. Right, I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful. I think it's a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic, you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic, we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior. Less chance of it being lost too, it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either. So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people. As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said? Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small, yeah. So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like. I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth. But we can like think of five, six designs.", "The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote. He presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design. The User Interface Designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface. The Marketing Expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device, and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology. The Project Manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function, that it be used only to control television, and that it include the company image in its design. The group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market. They discussed the functions the remote will have, including Video Plus capability and rechargeable batteries. A customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly, but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget. The group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers. "], ["A minute please, my uh laptop is uh oh, there it is, thank you. If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh warn you. But let's not uh go too wide about the those things, that's that why we're here. Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, that's a good point. Uh I've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind. Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think. Uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email. Um well, of course I I hope this is all clear to you. Yeah, but when all the questions I had Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_? Not first change menu options or switch something. If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low. And um, well, my conclusion is uh is uh less is more, keep it simple. Well um then I'd like to make a proposal. Well, yeah well, does it have to depend on the television? Oh um mo no, you can just say uh the c Yeah. In codes, y you you get a b a book with codes. Well then you have to buy a new one, it's very good for marketing Maybe, or an update, software update. Um, these were a couple of findings, first page of three. Um, as you can see here, the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five. I don't think that's uh really appropriate. First point is, seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly, uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Um, when you multiply them, you get the these three points. Um, I think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants, uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear. Um, I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five. Third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire, uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller, so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the, yeah, of the T_V_ where you can put the the remote control in. Um, yeah, maybe another problem uh, I think current T_V_s can even send infrared. Hmm it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen um, that in the middle are the the main keys, like displayed on the Uh yeah.. Yeah, this? He he he he me he means just just one other thing. A firmware upgrade or something, but from where? You don't buy a T_V_ every week, new teev so. And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open. So that's probably why most controls are still infrared. Well uh as I mentioned ready, we have some Bluetooth Well it may be possible, but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget, but that's not for me to decide, but that's maybe something for marketing to look into. But it may be uh may be something to explore. Or I press button but nothing's happening on the T_V_, so is is something wrong or something. So that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user. So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all. Um, well we should uh look into the design and the functionability. And that was my uh my presentation uh Yeah, but Yeah. Yeah, yeah, like like the iPod idea that that we just saw. Yeah, I wou I would actually go for the Yeah. I I do Uh I do agree, because well, it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button, but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience. Oh, yeah yeah, sure, that would be possible, yeah.", "When this functional design meeting opens the project manager tells  the group about the project restrictions he received from management by email. The marketing expert is first to present, summarizing user requirements data from a questionaire given to 100 respondents. The marketing expert explains various user preferences and complaints about remotes as well as different interests among age groups. He prefers that they aim users from ages 16-45, improve the most-used functions, and make a placeholder for the remote. The industrial designer begins explaining the working design. He talks about existing products, most of which use infared since it is simple and cost-effective. He suggests adding a speech function, when someone asks where the remote is and it beeps. He also explains the various components, materials, and energy sources of a remote, giving preference to a remote with multifunctional buttons and without a receiver. The interface specialist presents, talking about the possible components of the remote and concluding that the remote should be simple and accessible without too much functionality. The group continues the meeting by having discussion about the possibility of a touch screen, LCD, and other functions. The group closes the meeting and goes to lunch. "], ["Um, Project Manager, I have something to tell you. And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete. Um, well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have. Um, always display the primary buttons clear and visible. Maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space. So here are gonna be the program buttons. And the the volume control and program control maybe. But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_, do not display twenty other options that are possible. You're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see, but well, I I when I think, oh yeah, for the f for all the standard channels, and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels, because if you're watching uh, I don't know, you're in the at day uh, cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night. But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh, hearing loud noises from the T_V_, someone screaming one, and you f the channel switches, uh Yeah. Is t some menu uh function, you choose parental control, and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on. Um, well What I was thinking about is just a menu structure, when you don't use it is simple. Well, you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds, they'll still remember it. And it it l linger on every time you see it. And when the battery doesn't work, I usually shake it too. I can't imagine how how how it looks like. Well, I think that touch-screens are generally square. Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan. Our main audience, uh so that's people below forty, uh prefer the following. Very basic colours, like Janus explained. Okay, our secondary audience, uh people above forty a forty years in age, they like the dark traditional colours. Uh, I'll I'll come to that in a second point. And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it. But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call. Yeah but What I see uh How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents, children. And there are buttons uh behind it which you can use, if you d if you don't if you don't have a Yeah. Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view. Like at In the experts view, you have a lot of more buttons. And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh, well, what what d do we want, and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group. And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes. Uh kinetic, that's when you move something, then uh it gets energy. That would be actually very nice, uh I figured. Well, we could also use a battery, that's a bit Yeah. So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_. But, what l what Jarek said, you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves. You ha I you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh I figured that's a bit boring. So you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved. Or but but you could go in a in an double curves. And that's like several different dimensions. But you could actually go like uh something like this. Yeah, yeah I mean uh plastic uh is Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it, like plastic uh Your your I usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap. You Uh, I figured it will be m rather than hard Nah, rubber c uh this is a casing, yeah. So mm Uh uh so uh so what are the opinions? Uh, tra uh traditional versus L_C_D_, well I figured we we all set on that. Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_, we we should have the advanced. Okay, well that's my uh Uh, you're welcome. So, a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model. But you still have the problem about uh the television itself. Well yeah, you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself, for the more advanced users. Components concepts and user interface concepts. Uh, with the type and uh the the supplements. At the end, uh I will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder. Yeah, but you don't move a a remote control too much. And that's enough to to keep the energy level uh Okay. That's the material the younger people want uh, ain't it? Maybe you could use your remote as a phone. Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it, because uh you Yeah, you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff, and you heard on the news that uh that he Yeah, they believe that children uh are influenced by the television, and uh Well, we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years. Uh but there may not be too many buttons. I have a little w uh little chat to do and uh then we uh finish. I uh couldn't uh Okay, uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey, and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider, instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us. And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard. But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email. Yeah, the well, uh dids this what I uh what I heard.", "The project manager went over the agenda. The industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source, materials and components. He recommended using kinetic energy, and having a double-curved rubber case. The group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy. The marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material. He explained that the remote should look fancy, and be technologically innovative and easy to use. He suggested using removable customisable covers, speech recognition, installing some games into the remote, and implementing a parental control feature. The user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons. Most features will be controlled through the menu. The group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition. After a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature. The project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management. The group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote, including having an animated logo on the touch screen. The project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting. "], ["Do you want to replace existing file, no. Um, all these things have cost implications. Right, okay so um And the second one underneath would be the idea for the Right, okay. So that should uh Right, so, seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that uh Right. We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements. We'd have one special colour and one special button form. And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on. Makes sense.. Sorry, do you want that back up? Okay, but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost. Yeah, why not not, m m maybe nearer three. In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic. The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five. And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker, then because that the other functions we've got in are are more at the The special material, the rubber, wood, titanium, et cetera, if you go for that, th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six, whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two. I would go for a one on that at this point in time. Um, incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer. Well, you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements. Okay, so So we're going for plastic, yes? So, special colour, you want three in there. And we've got special form is the one apple. I would have thought that's probably about r well. And that amount Yeah, we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it? But but i but in the sense that, as you saw with um the Windows logo badge, it doesn't really matter. Oh drats, I've botched that, haven't I. Right, okay um What's happened here? So, uh I think I have to finish that page. So Whereas, this time, you're really getting it from a database source, so it's not uh well uh Anyway, so, what do you want to put down? So uh, and that was a project I suspect similar to this, because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work. Right, so, uh are the costs within budget, yes. They're thinking For the first time, well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons. This this is a yes, this is our presentation of the prototype. The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote. Okay, well we have a single curve, which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good. Yeah, m um Yeah, it was just doing it quite well. Um Do we actually have Do we just have one special uh special forms down here? Ne uh Maybe that'll be a second supplement. Yeah, that's twelve point three, so we're still within budget on that. Yeah so it's a Whatever fruit was in fashion next year. I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface, which is by far the cheapest. So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off. And we seem to have least something in each criteria. Y no, it's a slightly curved around the sides. And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line. And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on. But um, we didn't have anything small enough to write. Uh, we just chose simple shapes for all them. So that's where the colour buttons came from. Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box. Well, I suppose it's rubber as it is, isn't it. Yeah, it's got the cherry and the sponginess. And it does have attributes that other products do. Yeah, I don't see how we could make it any more. Needs to be an enter button, but could just be the same as well. Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion, go to a three? 'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all. So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale? But I mean, I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these. We could do it as we d go along, the production costs, looking at the prototype. Well do we'll do it on the prototype, so do two, see how much it is. Um The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation. This this is just this is just for like the look. Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional. I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product. Um, for for innovation, so we've got the speech the speech thing, and Do you reckon a two? Lose a little bit on the fashion, yeah, but And then Yeah. Yeah, so Uh So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button, then maybe they could be a different shape. That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different seeing as we've got, you know, we've made it a a special form, so And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one. 'Cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to. le lemon sh I think well, we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something. Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something, and Page after page. To fill in these fill in these questionnaires Oh no.", "The first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top. It uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition. The initial cost was calculated at 13.70 Euros. Although over budget, the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes. On a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (1), incorporation of fashion elements (2), and brand recognition (2). Changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour. The team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity, although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed. However, the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting, especially since the requirements restricted it to TV only, and the budget was too small. Finally, some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition. "], ["Um like before we uh I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go. Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote. Should be child friendly design with few buttons, colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons. And how it would works, you press the button, the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider. She would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore. Well, I have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons, like that people know, or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what? Okay, yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm. Um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need. So, we looks like we are well within budget. In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser. But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished, as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much. Uh And I think team work I think was very very good, I think we really yeah. And uh I think we are we happy with the means we used? Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place. Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell. Yep uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical. I'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't I? And show the the prototype to consumer research groups, we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any. So um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please. I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors. Well, um we had what, eight eight euros twenty as our cost? And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend. And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway. Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now, so if you put my last slide back up there. Um and then how about how we doing on colour? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand. And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here, but Yeah. But um otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product. So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons, instead of having two mute buttons. I think you've done a good job, Miss leader. And we used the slide because it was better positioned. This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build. If we want to have more features than that. Just the look like, the button part I'll explain. Now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model. And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels. Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button. Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel, if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel. And at the end, it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly. One two three four five six seven eight nine Nine points, okay, yes.", "The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting, detailing the main points of each person's presentation. They do the prototype presentation which includes a model of the remote control. The group discusses this proposed model, approving of the small size and look of it. They goes over finances and are pleased to find that they are well within budget. However, while the marketing expert is doing the product evaulation the group realizes that they neglected to calculate voice recognition into the financing. Their cost had been 8.20 Euros and they have  4.30 left to cover it, so they decide to settle for whatever quality it will buy. They rate their product on its shape, size, color, feel, and functionality. They discuss the project process, talk briefly about adding more features, and one member suggests eliminating a mute buttons and include a diffferent feature. They are happy with the creativity, leadership, and teamwork within the group, and close the meeting by thanking one another. "], ["Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or, a as an optional thing, a kinetic energy, like in a watch, which you just shake and it produces energy. And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed, um people like wood, but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image, unless we would start two product lines. Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy. Well y you basically shake your remote, and then it powers up. But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess. And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases. I think we should start by by choosing a case. And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers, after the original trend-watchers return, about what the the best design would be. Um this is, this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have. Um this leads us to some personal preferences. So this would be very important that we at least include these features. Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be, the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped. So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station. This is not really This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people. Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it. And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete. So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it. The more original one, or the more standard one. Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat, single and double curved. So we can pretty much just do whatever we want. ' But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides, that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote. 'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff. So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound, um for uh on-off, um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down. Um yeah and Uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it. Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control, you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal. So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button, uh for sound uh Uh and uh for our design, um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so And that's it. So I believe one battery uh is just enough. So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones, uh when you can change the case of it. So um you want to put a display over here? Uh rem Yeah but this place um Uh it's Yeah I dunno um Yeah. But um the on-off button, um still on the top uh Yeah. Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today. And we are going to use default materials. So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts. So these are the points we have to discuss. But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station. I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use, with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it. So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it. Especially if they have the same writings on it. Can't we make uh Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one? But now it's Do you have it upside down or Do you have it this that's top? Yeah.. So then we get Here's That's the curve. Just that's for left hand and right hand users. So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder. And then we're going to uh try to finish our project, and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers, I think. And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again.", "The project manager opened the meeting and recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The marketing expert discussed his personal preferences for the design of the remote and presented the results of trend-watching reports, which indicated that there is a need for products which are fancy, innovative, easy to use, in dark colors, in recognizable shapes, and in a familiar material like wood. The user interface designer discussed the option to include speech recognition and which functions to include on the remote. The industrial designer discussed which options he preferred for the remote in terms of energy sources, casing, case supplements, buttons, and chips. The team then discussed and made decisions regarding energy sources, speech recognition, LCD screens, chips, case materials and colors, case shape and orientation, and button orientation. "], ["Now as an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface, how the remote looks like so that it is sellable, it is attractive to customers. Then it should have a next button, and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one. Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature. Yeah, so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser. Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace. Uh yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser. This could be uh one feature which could be sellable. No, it's it's, uh yeah, it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already, and then you're expecting an answer from th For example, you have a T_V_ system, I'm the user and my family members are the user, I will already record uh a question like, uh good morning, like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television. So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on. It will recognise my voice and will switch on. But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more. Um people like something that really fits in their hand. Go ahead, I'm trying to finish fast for you. Um and our preference is, as far as I'm concerned, are we got to get to the market before the competition. So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things, I think, that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product. And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular. They are more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them. You wanna try to come back to yours, and limit yours a bit? That that be really good, yeah, I agree with that. Bright, colourful, trendy trendy design, and strong. And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller. Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one, then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button, and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light. And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components, like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins, and also a capac uh a capacitor, three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm yeah, and di and a diode transistor. Uh so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons. Uh can you see the black uh, round marks? Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip. So that also we can have in a battery, uh or we can use solar sells. Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases. Uh usually, the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller. Yeah, maybe d uh I have just one more slide, I think. And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote. Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting. Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone. And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote. That will be your area I think, right, Jana.", "The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting. The interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces. The group comments on her presentation, and then the industrial designer begins presenting. She talks about the technical electronic components of the remote, explains how a remote works, and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control. She suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable, using a rechargable battery, and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip. The marketing expert presents, talking about user preferences for a small, simple, eye-catching, cute, appealing, and functional remote. Fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year, so a soft, spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable. The group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition, noting that if it is good quality it could be costly. They about the power source and review the objectives of the product. The project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete. "], ["And I'm uh an user interface my role is uh the main responsibility is user interface. And my role is to design uh a television remote control. Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_, it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also, like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system. Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design. Yeah, maybe it should have a light so that we can, we can just recognise where it is. Yeah, probably yeah, probably it's a yeah, yeah. Uh working design, yeah, it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design. I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap, because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them. But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it. Well, because you're s because you're silly. Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there. Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know. Um so yeah shapes right, you know, like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something, you know. Exactly, I mean just that's what I'm saying. In in that moment it has a sensor, i it it gets a certain darkness, it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep, I mean, that we can discuss that later, you know. So, we looking for a working design when we come back. That it, that it, that the price is a good price. Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes.", "The meeting opens with the group doing introductions by giving their name and role. Betty is the project manager, Francina is the user interface specialist, Eileen is the marketing expert, and Jeanne is the industrial designer. The project manager tells them they will be designing a new remote control that should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. They will be concerned with functional, conceptional, and detailed design. To try out the whiteboard, each group member draws her favorite animal on the board. They discuss the project budget and then talk about their experiences with remote controls. They seemed to agree that the remote should be compact and have a multi-purpose functions. They also agree that it should do something different that current controls cannot do and that it should be made of different colors, materials, and shapes. They also discuss a way of helping people find the remote when it is lost- a signal, whether it is a beep or light. Then they close the meeting with the project manager going over the tasks they are to complete and telling them they will meet again in about thirty minutes. "], ["Um, once again I'm uh gonna take minutes. Afterwards some uh eval eval evalu evaluation s sorry. Once again, forty minutes, so uh let's start. I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation. Well, the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of yeah. So, if it's in the dark place, you still see it glowing. We also have uh to do the evaluation, uh the production costs and uh stuff. If it's under uh twelve and half Euro, then it's uh ok uh okay. We have to uh fil uh, want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro. Yeah uh, but it it's one one thing, it's three Euro. So um Uh, b but i but the single-curved is just oh Oh, okay, okay. So uh, okay, a little less uh conversation. Uh well, the only uh thing that don't Yeah, single-curved, but there's a curve in it. So, uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk yeah. Yeah and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard, so I think that's the that's the main issue. And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word. All the mo yeah, are between one and two. You had expected it to to be uh more more uh Yeah. So you have as you saw, you have a little uh Oh, you can Yeah, thank you. Okay, so Uh well, just about, because uh Yeah, tomorrow? You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh Uh about all the meetings, what we have decided, a r r a report of this day. So, this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh yeah. Oka okay, okay, I I really didn't knew that. Well, maybe I can then do it one two three. If the order is in uh is is uh important, that's the word for. Uh, well all the things we have uh discussed, uh the energy, which uh turn out to be uh batteries, so that's Yeah, because yeah. Uh, he here it is still double-curve, the rubber, the flashy, the fruity, the removable. So, it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh Uh, it's very cheap, you you maybe you you you you come at uh It's very necessary. Yeah, okay, well I gonna redesign uh something now. Because I think it will Oh, five minutes from to finish meeting. Um, we're going to do that with a seven point scale. Or Yeah, p s Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product. But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it. But No, but does it have a lot of extra uh fun function more like Yeah. I I think it's it's It look like this one. May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here. Yeah, j ju ju yeah, v voting application. But, uh you can still discuss about it, but but click it in an application, that's a lot easier to process. No, you have to put uh, switch channels uh at the top, because that's the most used function and teletext at the second Oh nay, a volume changing, second. No, it's it's not very cheap, but that no, but it's a development inside corporation. We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here. But, this is like a remote control for children.. A weemote. It's also designed for people above forty. What do you think, uh Mister Project Manager? Yeah, it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape. But Well, other case, we can make it single-curved or uncurved. R if you uh promote a kinetic um I kinetic remote control, I mean, that would b sell better than an a normal remote control. You have standard old battery control uh remote con True. Just t t type text, and that that would be uh excellent. But uh, problem is, well you can't discuss anything well you you ca uh you can, but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now. We I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three. But if you you put a three on it, uh just figure well, everybody knows what I'm knowing, so they'll all just put a two on. Shall I give a short introduction and then uh Okay. Yeah, the panel just uh of course goes like this. So, you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips. Uh, but when you lost it you're just not Yeah, mostly when you lose your remote control, it it's under your Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it. Yeah, so we have to bake the ba back flat, and then No, it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think. Whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium. Stupid stupid pen, but uh Yeah, but but draw something uh difficult. Just like when you're writing on a letter. No, a as you saw on on this drawing, just open open this one or that one. Nah, okay, I I it's my opinion that I Yeah, it's can be saved easier.", "The project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda. The user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design, describing the shape and layout of the remote. The group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours, but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers. The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product. The group calculated the production costs. The group were 4 euros over budget, so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy. The project manager led the evaluation of the project process. The group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team. It was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings. The group were also had problems with the digital pens. The group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting. "], ["Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and I'll I'll show you the presentation. Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it. Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say, it's yeah yeah, it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat. And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer, just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on. And now we've we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top. Yeah, I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five, actually, 'cause Yep. Yeah, it was it was uh a voice voice recognition, yeah. The biggest one would be taking away if you took away If you to Yeah. If if you take away the voice, I I do I don't like to say it, but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. If you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five. We c we could s Yeah, we could say Yeah, I s And then say we recommend Yeah. Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty? Yeah, no, I thought it it went really well and I yeah, I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out, although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good. Yeah, I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned. Can't you get the one that we used for the last one? This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research. This is where I realise how tiny I actually am. How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel. Uh two and three quarters, it that right. Okay, criteria B_, criterion B_, technologically innovative. So, I'll work out the average for that again at the end. That brings it down to two, nice and simple, yeah. Based on what you've said there, I would say a one, true. Or we or if we want to really bring it down, we can do later. And finally, last but not least, easy to locate. That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate. Well, I hope that's uh clear to the team. There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing. S Has that not made any d if you click off that square now, has that not made any difference? If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference? But we're still working to um head o We can put in our recommendations. But we need to work to that specification to start with. And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful, but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance. Although we had our separate tasks, there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to um bounce off each other. I think it's really good that this has been very market research based, because just going back to mobile phones, I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really, you know, say is is obvious and visible. There are innovations in that that people don't really want. But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too? The case material is gonna be soft, rubbery, changeable. Where's the where's the voice recognition? So should we just change the design specification then? They like their gadgets, they like something that's completely different. I think the agenda one was where the um price was, wasn't it? We don't need something else to take that place? But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all. Yeah, I think it's new ideas in general, rather than Mm. Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it. I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds. Yeah, because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case. No I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, we can put point five. But shape and colours, that's something we shouldn't comprimi Where's that special form? Yeah, I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody. I never thought of a remote control with a flip top.", "The Project Manager went over decisions from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer presented the prototype and discussed its look, its internal components, and its interface. The Marketing Expert evaluated the product according to the initial product goals. The group then decided that enough of this criteria had been satisfied for the project to continue. The Project Manager presented the final cost of the device which exceeded the initial projected price point. The group decided to remove speech recognition but to propose to the management that it  remain in the design. The group then discussed their effectiveness as a team. All members felt that they interacted well and that they felt they could be creative. The Marketing Expert felt that the market-research based approach would help the project's success with consumers. The group did express, however, that the budget was overly constraining. The Project Manager instructed the group to fill out a final evaluation questionnaire. "], ["Uh, maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make? It's actually sitting, so it's sitting, it's not standing. Okay, I see it as one thing it's very supportive. Yeah, that c Okay, you wanna integrate everything into one like Okay. So simplification of symbols you could think of. Now, we're developing a remote control which you probably already know. So Okay, I'll leave space for everyone else. I'm not gonna ask you to guess, I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger. And I see them as majestic, and independent, and proud. So yes, yes, I don't think we have to I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that, um making that a key point, just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia, America, things like that. I mean I've got we got um we had three videos, a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls, um that you programme each of your things into, but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again. I don't think they tape things, I don't think they use Mm, yeah, the age gap. I find it really confusing, I kept getting lost in the phone, I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost, but that's just me. I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything. Hopefully that'll stay on, two-handed version. Okay, uh Again this is off the top of my head, I was gonna do a big cat too, um. I suppose they're all so independent, I'd put that one down again. Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too? Um uh scary, uh strong, yeah that's about it I think.", "The Project Manager gave an introduction to the goal of the project, to create a trendy yet user-friendly remote. She presented a long-range agenda for the whole project. The group introduced themselves to each other and practiced with the meeting room tools by drawing on the board. The Project Manager presented the project budget, the projected price point, and the projected profit aim for the project. Then the group began a discussion about their own experiences with remote controls to generate initial design ideas for making the product user-friendly. They discussed grouping features into a menu and adding an LCD display. They also discussed the look of various materials that may be used in the design, in keeping with the company's goal to create fashionable electronics. "], ["Um I'm gonna go for the dog, and I'm gonna draw one badly as well. So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room. If you just click return it should be okay. I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat. Um and this would be because they're very independent, uh they're very intelligent, compared to dogs maybe. Um and they can be very very affectionate. Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats. I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for. Um and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that. Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote. Neither am I. Oh I see, so we shouldn't really be Oh right okay, so. I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works. That information has come from our marketing manager here. And therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit. And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time. So um Experience with remote control, first ideas. Okay, so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily. Oh I w um basically I'll get back to you on that. But it seems to me sensible, 'cause as you rightly said, there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room. And I'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour.", "The group introduced themselves and their roles to each other. The Project Manager introduced the project aim and agenda to the group. The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard. The Project Manager discussed the projected production cost and price point for the device. The group began a discussion about their own experiences with using remote controls and about usability features to be included in the design. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to prepare the working design, the User Interface Designer to research technical functions, and the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification. The group discussed the function of the prototype and decided that they should restrict the remote to television for the time being. "], ["Um I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and um I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires. So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at. And uh who would be next, uh, I guess that would be you. Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh Mm-hmm. Uh okay, now I have On my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda, and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that. And uh what function, working design, how how does it work. Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear. And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately. But I think I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody. As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote. Yeah can you please go onto the next slide? And uh the uh the uh and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote. And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock, and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote. Cause that's where m my discussion starts. Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. I'd like the suggestions to be really specific, so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off, not something like you know whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the T_V_, the V_C_R_, the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp. 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use, and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room. Okay, so, my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle. Uh because once there's no be-back, well in sales they always say you know, be-backs don't come back. You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing. Um and then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign. Okay that's uh about it for me right now. 'Cause that might help with the marketing. So it um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there? So it might be helpful if we had a look at that. That that w that won't change much, will it uh? Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device. So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also, it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark. And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands and um so that uh Yeah, yeah, yeah and colours also, different colours, and No no no, it won't uh I don't think it will be like, you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more Yeah yeah. And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons. Yeah, yeah you don't us yeah yeah, usually. Uh it's not like that, I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so. It's like a t okay, it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television. Yeah, like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers, like designs and all so that w we can have that.", "The meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly, telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house. The project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated, and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors. The marketing expert resumes, talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful. The industrial designer gives her presentation, talking about components, materials, and energy sources. They discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children, making the buttons various shapes, and putting a display clock on the control. The interface designer presents, talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a T-shape and add an alarm clock function. They discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases. They close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases. "], ["Regarding those sizes, which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also, so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space. And are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery, it like it runs for long time? It's twelve point f Another question is like sorry. W w which one would last the longest, because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day. Second thing is yeah and second question is like, a mobile you can change the cover, you call it a skin or whatever. It could it would be comfortable to hold on also. Okay, uh would like to share something which I did here. Like, some some people have a Here you see this? So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer. Okay and you mean to the And the lower distance. Maybe we could start with the black and white. Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains. So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle. I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now. Welcome back everybody, hope you've had fun. You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost, things like that, um and our market was going to be young, business, kind of range. Uh, I don't think it counts electric lights no, but I mean not many you don't want to limit your market. If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less, you you wouldn't lose it so much. 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press, just like a mobile phone. So, we agree on Do we agree on the battery? So there's not a really a decision to be made there, um. No I think I we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it um psychedelic, you know, we could make it black and white zebra stripes, but that's not really what we're focusing on, what we're focusing on is the m you know yes. Okay we've got five minutes, um, or that might've been up for a while. But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards. Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. Um, findings, I've got my nice little picture there. So you wind up your remote control before you use it. But Yeah and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway. But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway. Um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery, 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches. Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things, they've got little lights on behind the buttons, so you can see what all the buttons are, like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote, but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off, if we decided to go for buttons that could light up. I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said. Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case. Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really, the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium, it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it, because of the expense of how much titanium is is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote. If you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen. So that was one of the first things we did. Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel, rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls. Okay, um, now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group, um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there, that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too? I just had another idea, I don't know if it helps with that, but just to do with the R_S_I_. Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got, couldn't they? You us if we just use the shell as an example again, you open that, you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand, yeah. Mm-hmm, so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, okay.", "The Project Manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting. The Marketing Expert made a presentation on trend watching, including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion. The Industrial Designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available. He suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials. The User Interface Designer presented his main interface design, which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the LCD screen for other functions, to keep frequently used features easy to use. He announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider, depending on price. The Project Manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design. It was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery, that the remote will feature an LCD screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons, and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available. Speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly. "], ["Okay, so we've got uh so we've got new project requirements. We discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway. So I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations. Uh there's the rubber on the right, I think. So the the top bit's the power source, yes?. Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme. Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted. So w so what was the circular thing that you were If it's just for T_V_, which is what it is at the moment. We've only got about another four hours left. Yeah, I think she said twenty seconds to um What was that last wee bit there? But that was only for young people that preferred it, older people didn't. So Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing, you know without sound recognition. Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command, a set command whatever that happened to be. We've got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly. But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras. So and if and we've gotta get to the end. So I don't know how long we have left of our uh time. But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is. You're also gonna have the channel tuner, as it were. I think you've got to do um control F_ eight. Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design. Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down, uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that. Um so my personal preference would be the right remote. But I suppose nine's not really excessive. That'd probably be really simple, they're cheap. And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause, well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu, but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly. Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel. But I don't really know what they're for, I've never used them. I just know they're something to do with Dolby. People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons. Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it. Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control? I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one. Okay, um Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design. Whether that'll be sort of two batteries, four batteries, um it may vary. That's the remote in itself, that's the components of the remote and how they work together. And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver. So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with Yeah. 'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need. I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up. Has to be simple enough to I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes. As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that? Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves. we're gonna have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it, to guide Presu uh I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work. Keep the other buttons but hide them away. 'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change. Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products, then, or do you have to do it via the remote? Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think Well shall we look into that and just get back together. '", "The Project Manager gave the group new requirements on product features. The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the working design of the device. He presented all the necessary internal components and how they operate together. He gave his preferences on energy sources and senders. The User Interface Designer presented the necessary functions of the remote, then compared the interfaces of two existing remotes. The group discussed making their remote more user-friendly; they proposed eliminating rarely-used buttons and making it easier to skip through channels. The Marketing Expert discussed user requirements with the group and showed that users wanted a fancier, less complicated remote that would not be easily lost. He suggested incorporating a menu and an LCD screen to satisfy these requirements. The group discussed how to incorporate a locator function. The Project Manager reminded the group to limit the number of complicated features due to the project's time constraints. The group had a discussion to decide on product features. They decided to include a clapping locator function and a device that allows the user to enter two numbers separately to get a two-digit number. Complicated functions will be hidden in a back panel.
