I am attaching the Form A for Power (East and West combined).
I am also attaching a copy of our 11/30 DPR and a reconciliation from the total MTM per the Form A  to the life-to-date forward MTM per the DPR (DPR and reconciliation are on two separate tabs).
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.
