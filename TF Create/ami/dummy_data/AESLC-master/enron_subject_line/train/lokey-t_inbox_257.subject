Morning, Teb: I just found the message you left yesterday.
Am sending you this email to see if you can get it.
Did you get my telephone message this morning about retirement plan here at SDE?
They put in 3% so I think I'll just have to let that be all that's deducted from my paycheck for the time being.
If you think this is definitely a mistake, let me know.
Please reply if you get this email.
Love,
