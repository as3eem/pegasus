Rules governing suspension of DA and threats of retroactive suspension We have helped assemble a coalition of ESPs and business customers to get the most liberal rules possible (e.g., customers can renew DA contracts, customers can add facilities if contract permits, ESPs can assign contracts to other ESPs with consent of customer, ESP and customer can modify existing contract provisions.)
The ESP coalition that we're a part of will file comments on Wednesday on how the suspension rules ought to work.
Retroactively suspending DA remains on the table for debate and remains a threat.
But support at the Commission for retroactivity has diminshed considerably and most think that the likelihood of retroactivity is low at this point.
One Commissioner--Carl Wood--continues to express support for pushing the date back, however.
