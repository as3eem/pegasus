Pam:  As a follow up to our call today, please obtain a specific date that we can expect the TV monitor set-up.
It would be a shame to install cable and TV set-up and move in the next month.
Also note that I have not heard from Iain regarding options on the table top desk copier.
Please advise status and date of expected delivery.
Thank you for your assistance.
