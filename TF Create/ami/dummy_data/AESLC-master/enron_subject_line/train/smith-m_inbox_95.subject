Please send me an e-mail with a list of accomplishments for January-April.
This will help all of us prepare for the mid-year reviews.
I would like an update at the beginning of each month.
On the list Include projects that you have completed and all the projects that you are currently working on.
I will compare your input with a list that I maintain.
Chris
