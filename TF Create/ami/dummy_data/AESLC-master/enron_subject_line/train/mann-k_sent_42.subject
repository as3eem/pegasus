Here's the latest version.
It looks ok to me.
The most substantive aspect  of it is that Calumet Power (or its affiliate) could end up the indemnity  obligations under the agreement.
(in other words, an entity without a lot of  money to fund indemnity obligations)  In my opinion this isn't important in  the context of the option.
Unless someone objects, I'll tell PERC that Enron is ready to go with the  assignment.
