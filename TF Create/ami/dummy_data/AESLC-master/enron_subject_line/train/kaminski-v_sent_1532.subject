Gentlemen,  I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3  power trading desks.
I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000).
Lance Cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it  very useful for modeling transmission problems.
Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this  recommendation.
Vince
