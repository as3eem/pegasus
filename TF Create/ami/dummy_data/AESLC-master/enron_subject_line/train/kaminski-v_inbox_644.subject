Vincent....on behalf  of Toshiba Corporation, we wanted to thank you for the valuable time you spent  with us on Tuesday and also for the great Brennan's Lunch!
We hope you and your  team felt that the time was well spent and you found the Boltzmann concepts and  model to be both interesting and compelling.
We know that we  threw alot of very detailed information at you in a relatively small amount of  time and of course it will take some time to digest.
We're thinking that  the best way forward may be a small research or prototype project where Enron  and Toshiba may be able to jointly test, analyze and benchmark the application  of this concept -- to determine it's feasibility and potential business  benefit.
We are very interested in your thoughts about this  idea.
