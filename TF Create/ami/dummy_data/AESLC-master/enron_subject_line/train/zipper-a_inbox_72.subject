According to the International Coal desk, the three brokers that have expressed interest are:  -	TFS -	GFI -	NatSource  Apparently the desk is not as enthusiastic about NatSource from their perspective, though they would be happy to see the other two getting access.
Let me know if I can further assist.
Thanks,
