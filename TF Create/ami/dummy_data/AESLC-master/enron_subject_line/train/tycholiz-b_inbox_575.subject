All,     Below are the confirmed list of names to be interviewed for the Origination Track, Wednesday, 28th November.
(there are a possibility of a further 3 candidates).
All of you are confirmed to interview, however I require another 4/5 interviewers (Manager/director level) to ensure all candidates are interviewed by 5 originators.
Pls advise who from your groups can facilitate interviewing.
Interview schedules/resumes will be sent to you early next week.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
