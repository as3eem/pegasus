I thought it might behoove you guys to know about this, even though I am  unclear as to its meaning myself.
Basically, Cara made a change in scheduling  that she did not change in Enpower, and it has to do with an ongoing deal  being managed by the short and long term northwest desks.
In addition, Carla and I zeroed out a deal for Diana Scholtes in scheduling -  473338 - selling to Modesto at NP-15 for BOM on peak.
For some reason, she  just needed it zeroed out for tomorrow, so we did not change the deal in deal  entry.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thanks,
