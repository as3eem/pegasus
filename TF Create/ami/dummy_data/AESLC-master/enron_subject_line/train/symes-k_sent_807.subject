Melissa Murphy would like us to begin adding a note in the comments section  of all the deals we change.
I know most of you already do this when you make  big changes to deals, but she'd like to see more comments more often.
Of  course this mostly applies to me, but I thought I'd pass it along just in  case.
See the attached e-mail, and let me know if you have questions.
Thanks,
