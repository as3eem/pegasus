ok....am wondering if i can get some feedback on attendance for  a b-day outing this sat.
night in houston...any takers?
i know some of you expressed interest, some requested sat night b/c of a whirlwind social calendar (alan wins!
), and some....have dropped off the face of the earth.
peace out, mes amis- emily ps....pass along to those i've missed, s'il vous plait

saturday?
