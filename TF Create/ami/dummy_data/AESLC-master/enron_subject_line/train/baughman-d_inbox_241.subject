This is a message from Rusty Tidwell.
mgs I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas.
My son, Marcus, and I would like to help out anyone who may need some assistance in taking down their Christmas lights/decorations or straightening up afterwards.
I realize we have several elderly residents along with people being "under the weather."
We would be glad to help, just give us call.
Happy New Years To All,
