We received their payment today.
It included Dec01 through Mar02 invoices, some of which were new due ENA, other net due BG&E, with the sum of all amounts being owed to ENA.
It appears that they netted accordingly.
We can discuss whether they is allowable or not.
(This is the same scenario as with Merced.)
Susan: Please note in the DLL that payment was received 3/21/02 and that they netted post-petition invoices.
Thanks
