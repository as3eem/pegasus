Janine:  With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted to  verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with:  (1)  RMT  (as principal for Houston FX desk)  (2)  EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).
In this  regard, was the services agreement between ENA and EEFT ever extended to  include RMT for internal trades?
(3)  Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk)  There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.
Thanks.
Sara
