Justin:  I haven't heard from you in some time now.
How is everything?
Are  you going to be in San Antonio?
I wanted to set up a short call to discuss equity trading and what Houston  and London can do (are doing?)
to stay abreast of activity and developments  on the trading desks.
Please let me know a convenient time for you.
Thanks.
