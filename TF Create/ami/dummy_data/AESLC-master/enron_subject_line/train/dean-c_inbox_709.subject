Top of the morning to ya  Yes its true !!
Some have heard the rumor but have no fear " Stumptown  bike and brew " is coming to a neighborhood near.
We did a "test ride" the other weekend and this drunken  debacle proved to be quality mahem for sure.
Just to give you an idea for Saturday.
The test ride  was out to Alameda Brewery, Lauralwood brewery, Moon and  Six Pence, Goodfoot and then "we closed up Dots".
You can meet us while on the ride if 3 is a bad time,  we'll be out for the night.
Any questions, give a call,  Cheers,
