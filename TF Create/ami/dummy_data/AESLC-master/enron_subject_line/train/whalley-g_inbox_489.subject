<<CSFB_EnergyTech_nov2601.pdf>>   Summary:  *	A quick look at the correlation between the performance of the Energy Technology stocks and the price changes in both natural gas and oil.
*	Our conclusion is that there is no meaningful statistical correlation over time.
Commodity price shocks may however exert short term influences on the shares but should not be used as a predictor.
