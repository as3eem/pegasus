Julia:  The EGM group is delivering to you this afternoon completed matrices for all of our material physical trading contract forms and selected counterparty-specific contracts, in each case organized by commodity traded.
Just a few things to note: (i) we have not included in our review the EGM trading contract forms for Japan, Australia and Singapore due to the time constraints (please advise if you would like matrices done for those offices); (ii) we have not included a review of trading contract forms used by EGM-related entities in Europe as we assumed that Justin Boyd's team (I left a message for Justin this morning, but I did not get a confirmation back) would handle; and (iii) finally, we are not attaching the templates to the matrices, but we can certainly provide them if and when needed.
Please let me know if there is anything else you need.
Alan
