Following is info on BPS, Pipeline Segment and EC meetings in April / May.
FYI - On the Triage call this afternoon, Kim announced the following BPS schedule for dealing with the recall order:  ** Wed 4/3 conference call 8:30 - 12:30 central - agenda - only to identify the issues and not to work on any of the issues at this point ** Wed/Thurs  4/10 - 4/11 face to face @ Con Ed in NYC ** Wed 4/24 conference call 8:30 - 12:30 central ** Tues/Wed 4/30-5/1  face to face in Houston - probably @ CMS   Kim indicated that on the 4/24 call we'd know better what additional meetings might be needed.
I suggested that since the Technical and IR are meetings are in Houston Mon May 13 (Tech) and Tues/Wed May 14-15 (IR), that if there needs to be another face to face about that time, that we could possibly have it that Thursday and Friday (May 16-17) in Houston.
Stay tuned on any dates after the May 1 meeting.
Kim is going to try to have the NAESB office post this schedule this afternoon.
**  Kim also asked me to remind everyone about the Pipeline Segment meeting to prepare for the BPS meetings (see her e-mail of 3/15/02)
