Hi Sally,   Attached is the first cut at average deal count and tenure information for EOL and non-EOL trading.
The only missing pieces at this point are European Metals and "Other", both of which we should have from London first thing in the morning.
I will send an updated file as soon as we have that information, and we wil be standing by tomorrow in case there are any revisions needed, or additional requests.
Thanks,
