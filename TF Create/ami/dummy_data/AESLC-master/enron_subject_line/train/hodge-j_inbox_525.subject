In the course of negotiating a master close-out netting agreement with J Aron/Goldman Sachs, they have now requested that after signing the Netting Agreement that we turn our attention to negotiating a Master Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement (I assume two, one for US and one for Canada) to replace the GTCs currently used for the US and Canadian trades.
Tanya: Could you have the appropriate person in Credit prepare a credit worksheet so Jeff/Peter's teams can prepare the draft Masters?
Thanks, Alan
