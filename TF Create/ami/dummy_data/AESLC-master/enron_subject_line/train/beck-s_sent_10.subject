Did Debbie talk with the two of you before putting together her memo?
Is she  raising this to me because she wasn't comfortable with the outcome of her  conversations with you two, or did she skip that step?
Just curious, before  I send any type of response.
I would need details from you around the  process for updates to Entelligence and Global Counterparty.
Surely one  feeds the other?
