Mark -  Are we still moving forward with the LegalOnline updating?
At this time, we have completed the background work on the databases (e.g., Confidentiality Agreements, Law Firms/Contacts, etc.)
and created the new look and feel.
We have not yet implemented the text of the new site and continue to have some problems with the streaming video (we cannot get the tape digitized as necessary because of flaws in the tape itself).
In light of current events, please let me know if we are to move forward with the project or not.
Thanks.
