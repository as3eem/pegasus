Hi Sally,  Wish you & your family a very Merry Christmas and a wonderful new year!
Hope everything is going well for you & you have been able to get sometime with your family during the holiday season.
I hate to bother you with this request because I realize you must be very busy; I was wondering if you had a chance to forward my resume to Ginger Gamble (at Reliant) and Carol Scherer (at Duke Energy).
The job market is really terrible right now and your recommendation will mean a lot for me.
Pl.
do let know if you would like me to resend my resume to you.
Best Regards,

Merry Xmas & Happy New Year!
