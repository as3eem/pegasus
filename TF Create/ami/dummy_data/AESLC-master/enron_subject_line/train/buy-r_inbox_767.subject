Public Relations / e-Biz called regarding the Risk Management Policy, and wanted to know if they could address it in e-Biz.
Initially I thought no, but perhaps you might want to take this opportunity to highlight other RAC issues of interest to employees.
I was thinking - maybe the roll out of the RAC website, 3-D data visualization tool recently profiled in Risk magazine, etc?
The contact person is Jeanie Mandelker at x36305 if you'd like to discuss it further.
I told her we'd get back to her next week.
