Mark:  I'm not sure whether this CP does financial trading.
Regardless, I've included the highlighted language that I had circulated with  the Idacorp draft; I think that you were mulling over whether that new language was acceptable.
Please let us know your thoughts so that we can finalize the new rider.
THANKS!
Stacy: Would you like to tackle ONEOK next?
Also, please let me know your thoughts on the bold faced language.
