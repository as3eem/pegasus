Bob   Here is what we sent TVA last year when we were notifying them of the  delivery points we would have delivered to.
I'm tied up in meetings the rest  of the day and we want to start notifying TVA of the delivery points we would  have used had we had an obligations to continue to schedule and deliver  energy under the MOPA,  Could you please revise accordingly and send back to  Bill Rust and me this afternoon,  We would like to start sending out tomorrow.
As always, thanks for your help.
Elizabeth
