Marcelo:  Attached are my comments to your initial draft of Appendix C to the Canadian  form of repo agreement.
Please note the following:  (1)  You attached "Annex II" to the end of Appendix C.  That annex came from  the US repo with Merrill.
The information should actually be incorporated  into "Appendix A" of your repo agreement.
(2)  I am waiting to hear internally regarding substitution and a default  issue.
(3)  Please let me know if we have any issues on the Appendix C (and add a  reference to Appendix C at the end of your printed form).
We should be ready to execute shortly.
Thanks.
