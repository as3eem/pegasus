Per my discussion with Joseph, I wanted to pass along to you the telephone number to the conference room where Laurie and Shirleen will be meeting on Wednesday, October 10, 2001 to discuss the foregoing.
The number to Conference Room EB 751 is (713) 345-4032  - - Jeff,  you should dial the conference room directly.
Thanks!
