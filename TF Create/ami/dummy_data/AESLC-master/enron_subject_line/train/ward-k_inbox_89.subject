As a reminder, our TW capacity release deal with Citizens expires at the end of the month.
We need to do a new capacity release deal to obtain it again through 10/2003.
It is my understanding that Craig Ludtke will be posting it or has already done so.
Please make sure you communicate with Craig so this happens.
Otherwise, we will have problems on the 1st.
