The National Energy Board has approved the TCPL 2001-2002 Settlement agreement in its entirety.
The link to the Reasons for Decision (RH-1-2001)is attached below.
Highlights - No change to current tolls pending final decision on Fair Return Hearing expected in late spring or summer, say June or July 2002 - AOS and FT Makeup Credits to IT Service to start effective Jan 1/02.
- IT Floor floats monthly between 80-120% of FT depending on AECO MI and seasonal marginal fuel rate (at current prices expected to remain at 80%) - NEB expected to review Settlement Guidelines in near future (potentially opening door in future to FERC style negotiated tolls)  Dianne Ripley (403-974-6913) is responsible for implementing AOS and FT Makeup for Enron Canada.
She and I can both answer questions about how it works.
