I have spoken to Oman LNG about our ETA.
They are unable to move forward the ship due to load after the "Hoegh Galleon".
They have asked that we try to arrive as early as possible on May 13 so that departure on April 14 can be achieved.
Please advise as soon as information is available on the progress of the work.
