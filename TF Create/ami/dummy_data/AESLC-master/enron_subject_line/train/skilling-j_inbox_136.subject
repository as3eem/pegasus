Jeff:  This is just a quick "head's up" to advise you that I am no longer retired and am CEO of an energy information start-up, Genscape, Inc., based in Louisvllle.
Two founders (32 year olds) left power trading positions to pursue the development of technology able to measure the electric and magnetic fields emanating from high-voltage lines connected to power plants.
They were successful and can now translate those measurements into highly accurate estimates of transmission line load and direction and from that make a highly accurate estimate of a power plant's generating status.
The information is delivered to customers via Internet on a real-time basis.
Genscape will by year end have built a monitoring network capable of monitoring 250+ plants or startegic transmission points in the Continental U.S.  Genscape's initial customers are energy trading companies and subsequent customers will be power generators, transmission and distribution operators, insurers, fuel suppliers and transporters, regulators and wholesale power consumers.
The reason for the "head's up" at this time is that I'll be meeting with Scott Tholan of your staff on Tuesday, May 1, to review Genscape's product.
