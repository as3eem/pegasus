Dad, I know this has been more difficult than I can conceive, so I did what every good seminary student should and looked for something that might help a little.
Solomon, when he was made king, asked only for wisdom and God gave it to him as well as many other blessings.
The wisdom, as you well know, helped him to be a great ruler.
There is no doubt God has already given you great wisdom and will continue to bless your life.
You are always in my prayers.
Love,
