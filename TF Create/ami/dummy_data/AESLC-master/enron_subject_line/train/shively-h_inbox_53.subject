Hi Hunter,  I tried sending you an email earlier but I didn't have the right address.
How are things?
I am still looking for a job.
I have attached a copy of my resume to this email.
If anything comes your way could you please let me know.
I am not necessarily fixated on trading.
It would be optimal but I will do anything else for now.
Thank you for everything,
