Starting on Monday, January 12, we will begin discussing various topics on gas fundamentals.
For the next few weeks, we will meet from 2:00-3:00 each afternoon in room ECS06716.
I would like everyone's input and new ideas on how we can improve going forward.
A tentative schedule of topics is attached.
