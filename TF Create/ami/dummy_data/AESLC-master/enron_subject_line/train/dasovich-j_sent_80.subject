Greetings Dr. Gobbo:  If my memory serves, you should have arrived back in Italy, or will return  soon.
Since we met, I have spoken with Severin Borenstein, who is intimately  involved with California's electricity restructuring (melodrama?)
and a  renowned energy economist  at UC Berkeley.
Severin has offered to serve as a  contact for you as you continue to take on the formidable task of  restructuring your country's electric industry.
I've included his contact  information below.
And, of course, if there is ever anything I can do for  you, do not hesitate to contact me.
All the best,
