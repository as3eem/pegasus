Ed, sounds like you have this handled - I would like to use your report as  the example to use in other groups.
It can wait until you have it all  completed.
You may want to think about EOL as well (ie) how many companies  have you brought on-line, etc.
summary:   - coverage metrics;   - market iniatives;   - completed deals;   - hot list;   - EOL metrics.
