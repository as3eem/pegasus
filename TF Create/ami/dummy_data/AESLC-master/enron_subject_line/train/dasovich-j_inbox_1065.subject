Folks,  FERC is deliberating today on many agenda items.
Two they have approved are:  1.
Modifying the June 19 Price Mitigation Order setting the price cap at $108 until April  30, 2002, and decoupling the cap from California's reserve deficiency, and instead tying the cap to the price of natural gas (upwards, only).
2.
Denial of Requests for Rehearing (in great part) on all California Orders since last December 15 (2000), and ordering the California ISO to submit a revised congestion management plan, and a plan for establishing a day-ahead market, both plans due May 1, 2002.
Both Orders passed 3 Yea, and 1 No (MAssey, in part on the second order).
