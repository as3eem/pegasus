Tim/Mary/Naveen,  David Port and I are working with Accenture to benchmark and analyze our Liquidity and Collateral Management Process.
We have asked them to analyze the metrics currently utilized at Enron relative to our internal needs and relative to other leading companies.
During this process they may wish to meet with the two of you to gain a better understanding of the Treasury group's Liquidity management process.
Please advise if you have any questions before I give them the go ahead to contact you regarding this project.
Bill
