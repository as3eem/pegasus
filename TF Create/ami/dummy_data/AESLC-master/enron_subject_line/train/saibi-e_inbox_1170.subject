Hello everyone!
I hope you're all as excited as we are!
We're very anxious to see everyone :-)  We have pondered the idea of the Bachelor/Bachelorette party, and we both would rather have all our friends together, rather than seperate.
So we hope you will all join us on Friday November 30th at 8:00 PM 655 Baker St. #BB103 Costa Mesa 92626 We will meet there, then carpool/tailgate to the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach for an evening of drinks, desserts, and jazz.
Please reply and let us know you'll be coming.
We hope to see everyone there!
:-)  Adnan & Maylynn
