Daniel works by the hour and is a really hard worker and a nice person.
He  is from Honduras and speaks only a little English.
To contact him, call me at 713 526-9824  (at 508 Willard).
I will tell him  you are interested.
He has trapped possums, cleaned floors and done  gardenign for me.
For others he has done painting, sheetrock,  light  carpentery, etc.
