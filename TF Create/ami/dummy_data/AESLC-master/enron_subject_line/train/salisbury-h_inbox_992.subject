Bill; Spoke to Mike Cashell again this morning.
If you remember when we met with him this Spring, he mentioned that Idaho Power had the right to demand energy and or wheel through MPC's system that could cause them to be out-of-balance up to 25% of the time.
Starting yesterday Idaho initiated this process.
Mike has requested Idaho express their intentions on a preschedule basis where he in turn will notify you.
Today (6/22) and throughout the weekend MPC plans to be in a deficit position.
You might want to contact Mike (406) 497-4575 to work out a pre-notification process so as to help to identify "trends" so that our Real-Time group will be able to better anticipate MPC's needs.
Thanks,  John
