Eric, like the United Way, our goal should be 100%participation.
In order to  reach that goal, we need the reporting mechanisms to determine which groups  and managers have very low participation rates.
I strongly believe that ENA's numbers would be better if we had north of 80%  participation (ie) the "unhappy" folks are more likely to input info than the  "happy" folks.
