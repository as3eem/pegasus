Gerald,  Per our conversation yesterday, attached is the Unocal Term Sheet for your review and comment.
This is a non-binding proposal.
Note that the items in red are either questionable items or rates/prices that need to be confirmed and/or filled in.
The compression guys are meeting with Unocal tomorrow (Friday) early afternoon to discuss the project and term sheet.
Please advise.
Thanks, Lisa Druzbik
