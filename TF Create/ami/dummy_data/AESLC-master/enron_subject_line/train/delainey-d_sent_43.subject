Rebecca, if you wouldn't mind I would like to sit in on the Monday meeting.
I think that Mariella from what I have seen and heard is very capable.
I  strongly believe that we need to put a dedicated (with fresh eyes) SWAT team  on this one that has control of the complete commercial, technical and  financial aspects of this project.
This is the only way to be effective.
Whether it is with you or me or both, I am indifferent  I would like to ensure that Kishkill, Wiggs, Gonzales and Alberquerque are  not buried in this project given other goals and objectives.
Thanks  Regards
