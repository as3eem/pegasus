I am sure that you are enjoying your break from school.
It is always great  to have finals behind you and several weeks of vacation stretching in front  of you.
No doubt you are spending time thinking about your next step after  graduation.
I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about  your offer while you are going through that process.
Enron had a fantastic  year in 2000, and we are excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.
We  hope that you will be a part of that.
