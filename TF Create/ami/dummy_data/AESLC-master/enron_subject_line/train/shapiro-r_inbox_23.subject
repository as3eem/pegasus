Hi Rick,   The revised document that I sent to Robert is the same as what you saw, with the following additions:    The bullet point saying that NYMEX transactions are okay has been deleted based on Sarah's conversation with Adam Wenner.
The Enron affiliates with market-based rates are listed in the two footnotes.
Several "plain English" edits from Paul have been incorporated into the first page.
Sorry this went out so late.
I'll give you a call in the morning.
Sue
