Folks,  Some of you were looking for a list of who's coming.
Shown below is a headcount that should be fairly up to date and includes people who signed up for either the Class Dinner, Class BBQ or Golf Tourney or some combination thereof.
If you know some folks who are missing from this list it would be a good idea to get ahold of them asap as we haven't received payment for any events!
For last minute signups please call the Alumni Office (310) 333-ALUM.
You can also pay at the door for most of these events, but it is highly advisable to let us know you plan to come!
Sincerely,

@subject
