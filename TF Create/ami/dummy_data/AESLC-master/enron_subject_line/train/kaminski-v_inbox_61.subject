Dear Vince   I have not heard from you for a few days and was  wondering what is happening.
The last time I spoke to Shelley, everything was  fine and that you were still going ahead with your presentation and  co-presenting the workshop on energy risk.
Please do reply to put my mind at  rest!
Thank you
