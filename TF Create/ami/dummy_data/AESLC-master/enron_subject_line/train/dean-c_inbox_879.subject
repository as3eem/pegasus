A hour ahead 24 has been sent to the ISO for 10.10.01.
HE 13-20  APX1 SP15 purchase increased by 25 MW STCA SDG1 load decreased by 25MW  This was due to a scheduling problem which occurred with BPs (SC ID APX1) sale to STCA on 10.09.01 They preferred to schedule their sale hour ahead and we have agreed.
This will be a one time arrangement.
Thanks, Serena
