i will be on vacation for the next couple of days and ernie and i will be going to play golf at meadowbrook farms (very good and nice course) on moday morning.
i have two free rounds of golf and we wanted to know if two of you would like to go.
if we got two more we could split the price ($65 per) between the four of us.
that would be about $30 per person to play.
i realize everyone is probably working but we thought we would share, and allow you guys to play some golf with the uhhhfffllll league leaders and members of the best division in our league.
we could even let you guys pick our brains as to how we have been able to dominate the league so far.
