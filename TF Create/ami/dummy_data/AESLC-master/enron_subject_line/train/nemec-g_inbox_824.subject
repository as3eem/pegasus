Any member who would like to have his or her photo taken may come by the Houston Bar Association office between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on June 19 or June 20.
There is no charge for the photo, no appointment is necessary, and the photo sessions will take only a few minutes.
The Houston Bar Association office is located downtown at 1001 Fannin, Suite 1300.
The HBA hopes to have as many current photos as possible in the new Roster, so please take advantage of this opportunity.
