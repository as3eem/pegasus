Hello Golfers,  Just a reminder that the block of rooms at the Ameristar Casino / Hotel at the group rate expires 8/17.
Don't forget to make your reservations at 888-833-7700.
There are only a few spots open for the golf and there is a limit of 144 paid players, so if you know of anyone that plans to attend ask them to contact me 303-308-6148 or Mike Martin 806-378-2376.
We need someone to volunteer to host the golf tournament next year so that we can keep this going as an annual event.
If your company has an interest please let me or Mike know.
Thanks
