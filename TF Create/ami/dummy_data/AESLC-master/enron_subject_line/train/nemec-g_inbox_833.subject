Bruno,  Per our telephone conversation of this morning, I am forwarding you marked and clean versions of the revised LOI that addresses the open issues relative to the $50,000 breakage fee.
Please keep in mind that Julie Gomez has not yet had a chance to review this version of the document.
Please feel free to contact me or have your counsel contact me with any questions regarding the attached.
