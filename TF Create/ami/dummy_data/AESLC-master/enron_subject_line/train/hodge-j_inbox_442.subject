Dear Jeff:  Just to follow up on my voice-mail message of this morning, please let me know the status of Enron's review of the GISB drafts sent to you on Monday, October 29th?
We consider these negotiations a top priority and would like to finalize the GISBs with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp. on an expedited basis.
Please contact me to discuss.
Kind Regards,
