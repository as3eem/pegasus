Jill,  Bob Walker has informed me that Pioneer has requested the existing GISB with  ENA be assigned to ENA Upstream.
The GISB at issue was acquired from  Columbia Energy Services.
In light of this there would be no need for a new  GISB with Pioneer.
To date,  Pioneer is holding final version of  our GISB.
