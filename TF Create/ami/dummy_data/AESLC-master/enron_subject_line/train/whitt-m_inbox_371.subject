Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:  Yesterday, we filed with FERC for approval of the fifth tie-in segment (to gate #6) contracted  for  115 Mdth/day.
This will bring the firm capacity of the Medicine Bow system to 495 Mdth/day.
We will notify you as soon as we have approval.
Please call me if you have any questions.
