Debra, as we discussed, here is credit assurances language that Select proposes to add to the Firm GTC, in addition to the other changes requested by Select on 10/15/01.
Credit Assurances.
If either party (Party A) has reasonable grounds to believe that the other party's (Party B) creditworthiness or performance under this Firm GTC has become unsatisfactory, Party A will provide Party B with written notice requesting Performance Assurance in an amount determined by Party A in a commercially reasonable manner.
Upon receipt of such notice Party B shall have three (3) Business Days to remedy the situation by providing such Performance Assurance to Party A.
In the event that Party B fails to provide such Performance Assurance, or a guaranty or other credit assurance acceptable to Party A within three (3) Business Days of receipt of notice, then an Event of Default  will be deemed to have occurred and Party A will be entitled to the remedies set forth in Section 3 of this Firm GTC.
