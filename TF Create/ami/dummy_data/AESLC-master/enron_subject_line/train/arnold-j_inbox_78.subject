John -  I want to confirm that you received the literature on the UBS PaineWebber Private Equity Fund III and the Tamarack Fund.
The Private Equity III literature refers to a December 17 closing date; however, we have extended that closing, so you may still be able to participate.
Have you reviewed the material, yet?
Thanks,
