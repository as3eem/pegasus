Tom,  Your Ice ID should be working now, however the aventail log in is not.
Please use the following Aventail login until they have this issue resolved:  User ID: production Password: bug1fox9  Your Ice login:  User ID: thmartin password: spinit32  Please let me know if you have any questions.
I will let you know as soon as ICE has the Aventail login working appropriately.
Thanks,
