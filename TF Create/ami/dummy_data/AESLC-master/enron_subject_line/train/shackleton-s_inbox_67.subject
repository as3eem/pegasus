Mary, Do you have an Enron North America Corp. bank account I can use for Goldman Sachs.
The hedge book is in a grouping of accounts under ENA.
In the past, we have wired to ECT Investments Inc.'s Citibank account but this is probably not a good idea at this time.
The amount is $985,614.39.
Please advise.
Sheila
