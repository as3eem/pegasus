In an effort to avoid loss of our executed agreements/files (master  agreements, brokerage and futures agreements, repo agreements), we are  testing out the  "library approach" and instituting a checkout procedure.
Whenever you remove one of these files from the file cabinet, please "hold  the file location" with a signed "card" (legal sized) available on top of the  master agreement file cabinet.
You will also see a large sign reminding you  to sign out for your file.
When the file is returned, just replace the  "card" with the file and delete your name from the "card".
Please be sure to check out all files currently in your office.
Thanks for your cooperation.
