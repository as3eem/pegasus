Joel,  I have attached both the agreement for the ROWs and for the purchase of the 2.82 acres of the Crawfish land that Bridgeline is acquiring.
Please review and comment as necessary.
In the meantime, I know that you have been working with Roger to finalize the actual ROWs that Bridgeline is requesting.
We can modify the ROW agreement accordingly once that has been finalized.
Thanks for your help,
