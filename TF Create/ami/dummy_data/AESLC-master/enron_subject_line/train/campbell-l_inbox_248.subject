On September 14, 2001, the Commission accepted tariff sheets filed by NEPOOL, effective July 1, 2001.
The tariff sheets conform the existing mitigation price screen provisions of Market Rule 17 applicable to resources that run out of economic merit order to the revised bidding and compensation regime of three-part bidding and Net Commitment Period Compensation.
NEPOOL explained that the proposed differences in percentages applicable to the Energy Block Price were appropriate since they apply to different base values depending on whether the resource is regularly or seldom run in economic merit order.
The price percentages applicable to Startup and No-Load bids are the same for both resources as both resources use the same base value.
If you need further information, please let me know.
