Barry,  In order to get Kim Ward VPN access from her Click@Home or non-enron PC, I will need you to e-mail my manager, Paige Cox, with the number of people in your group that need to work from home and the business reason behing it.
Once Paige gets approval, I will be able to assist Kim and the rest of your group get the VPN access from thier homes.
Thanks,
