We are considering including the attached provision (or something) similar in our Transaction Confirmations.
I would also like to propose it to EEI and WSPP for sample language that could be included on confirms.
Would any of you have a problem agreeing to this?
If so, what are your concerns?
I know you are all real busy right now and appreciate your consideration of this matter.
Thanks in advance.
