Attached is a matrix of Order 637 issues by intervenor/customer indicating which issues they protested.
Along with Teb's outline being prepared, I thought this might be useful as an at-a-glance sheet for each customer especially prior to any informal meetings that may be held before filing revisions to our original proposal.
If you have any questions, please give me a call.
