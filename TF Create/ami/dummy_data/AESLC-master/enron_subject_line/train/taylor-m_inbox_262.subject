Steve - in order to draft the contribution agreement for RMT to transfer the ETP partnership interests to swapco, we will need to review the partnership agreements (1) for required consents, etc.
and (2) to schedule the interests in the agreement.
Do you have copies of the appropriate partnership agreements and, if not, do you know from whom we could get them?
Thanks.
