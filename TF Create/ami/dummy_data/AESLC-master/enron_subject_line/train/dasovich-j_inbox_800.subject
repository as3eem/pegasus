You're undoubtedly getting calls and questions about the recent media coverage.
Given the SEC inquiry and a slew of lawsuits, we are limited in what we can say.
However, we have compiled Frequently Asked Questions and posted them on the web, so feel free to direct people there:  www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/faq.html.
The most recent press releases are also posted on the web in the press room.
We are working on additional questions and answers that will be posted as soon as they are approved.
If you have specific questions, please let me know.
Thanks!
