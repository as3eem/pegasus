Howdy!
My name is Jennifer Bohac '87 and I am the new Director of Travel for The Association of Former Students.
I am excited to be here and look forward to working with you.
We are currently scheduling the trips for 2002, lining up some wonderful and exciting packages and destinations.
I think you will be very pleased at the great trips we are putting together -- there will be something for everyone.
We will be featuring two "Young Aggie" trips,
