Enclosed is a revised draft of the policy without any modifications on the  exclusions as this is an area that ACE is apparently continuing to develop.
As I mentioned yesterday, we will talk with you about this on Monday at  1(Houston time).
Our commercial team would then like to have a call with ACE  sometime after our call to talk about exclusions, subrogation rights and  matters relating to books and records that are addressed in the policy.
I  don't think that all of you need to be on this call but was wondering if any  of you would be available for this call.
Please let me know.
