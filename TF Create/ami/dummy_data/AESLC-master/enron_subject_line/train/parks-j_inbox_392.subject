Joe:  The GISB contracts for TXU are acceptable.
I'm filling in the blanks and waiting for Theresa Vos to send me some info.
Left a message for Tim Powell stating that I should have these contracts back to him by today.
Regarding an invoice, Theresa will prepare it but how much gas did we sell TXU?
Price?
etc.
Or do I get that from Tim??
