Apparently, they don't have kids.
As the father of five, I know that we Baby Boomers will be spending lots of money on our Baby Boomlet for quite some time even if we've lost some of our job security and some of our stock market wealth.
Today, there are roughly 76 million Baby Boomers, who were born between 1946 and 1964.
They are 37-55 years old.
They've been busy with their careers, but not too busy to have some sex along the way: They've had an estimated 75 million kids--currently aged 0 to 25 years old-- since 1976.
