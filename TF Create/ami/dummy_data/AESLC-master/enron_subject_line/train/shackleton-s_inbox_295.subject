Gary Hickerson has authorized the addition of Deutsche Bank for Futures Trading.
We have been using Carr Futures in the European Market but Carr Futures no longer has the presence and coverage needed; whereas, Deutsche Bank can fulfill our trading needs at competitive clearing rates.
I will forward the account opening documentation to Legal when received.
