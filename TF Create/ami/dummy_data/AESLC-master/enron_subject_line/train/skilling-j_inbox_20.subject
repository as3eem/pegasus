Hi Mark;   Thank you for the comments on Macedonia.
I take it you have started your book since you said "Details will be in the book!"
Not much new here most excitement is about a May 5 Wedding!!
The White Sox are having a slow start with a 4-7 record and neither the hitting or pitching very good.
However the season is young ---- I hope.
