Dear Marie,  I note from your email of 27 August that you were going to get back to us with your further comments once Sara Shackelton returned from vacation in September.
I wonder if you have now had a chance to discuss this issue with Sara and if you have any feed back for me.
Thanks very much for your ongoing assistance in this matter.
Kind regards
