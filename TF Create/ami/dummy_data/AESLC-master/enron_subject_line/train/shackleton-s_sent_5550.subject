Dee:  I am trying to hear from credit on about four issues, namely, the legal  entity, need for First Union Corp. guaranty (due to the availability of  financials), haircut on bonds and Specified Conditions.
I would then propose  preparation of a blackline to squeeze out the remaining issues.
If I hear  from credit tomorrow (and I'm pushing), I could have the blackline by  Wednesday and we could talk.
Hopefully, we'd be done by this week.
Hope  this works.
Regards.
