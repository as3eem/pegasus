All,   The RUNM application will be changed in the near future.
We urge all the users to please test the application by typing the following:    runmm - to run it in production runmt - to run it in egstest runmd - to run it in egsdevel    Please note that runm will eventually be replaced by runmm.
If you have any further questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact me at x57252 or Francis Lim at x35906.
Thank you so much for your cooperation and support.
