Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is  similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes:   a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the  paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination;  b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no  outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron  Mexico;   c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I  would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in  which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work  together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding  outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC  and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico  coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in  Houston should provide a winning team.
I am asking for the three teams to  clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people  and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer  (ASAP).
I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the  sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and  execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.
Either way, I am  expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for  Canada and Mexico;  and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at  this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and  if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to  ECC.
