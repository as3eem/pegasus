Document		Signature Act of Sale Form  	Jean Mrha/Julie Gomez  Board Resolution	Mark Haedicke 			Louise Kitchen  Corporate Guaranty	Jeff McMahon/Ray Bowen (DONE for $3 MM)  Certificate of Non-Foreign Status Stephen Douglas (DONE)  DASH 			Rick Buy/Dave Gorte 			Jean Mrha/Julie Gomez 			Mark Haedicke 			John Lavorato/Louise Kitchen 			Jeff McMahon/Ray Bowen  This DASH definitely needs a Legal Risk memo, which I have attached as a separate document.
Along with the DASH, it needs to be updated for the actual sale price (and the date was wrong--I fixed that on the attached but be sure Gerald's version has the right date) and then added on to the body of the DASH before signatures.
Gorte has already looked at this one, so we should be okay to get going on the signatures right away, though I would still start with him, just in case.
