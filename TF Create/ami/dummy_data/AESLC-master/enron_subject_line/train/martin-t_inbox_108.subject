Tom,   I received an e-mail from Linda Carter asking about certification.
I assume you will get a schedule tonight at the meeting.
She was asking about David, her son, being certified this year.
The way I read the new rule, is that you have to be 19 to be certified.
I told her I would ask you to ask about that new rule at the meeting tonight to be sure we understand it.
It is posted on their website www.nwal.org .
