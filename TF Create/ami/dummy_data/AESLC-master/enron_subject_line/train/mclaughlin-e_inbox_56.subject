Status report of integration testing from Tuesday, Jan. 22nd      (completion of subset of Gas/ Power scenarios to test that all platform components are setup)   We've completed the remainder of test scripts, including transmitting invoices to SAP successfully!
And all reported testing issues are resolved (need confirmation by a few users).
Thanks to all involved!
It was very productive as 16 issues (8 from Unify) were identified and resolved (attached).
A spreadsheet is attached of the outstanding/ resolved issues   If any testing issues are missing and not reflected, please email Terry Sanvido or myself to assist with tracking and resolution.
The importance of Wednesday's test below is:        (1) to test after all estate data removal is done; as if testing a Netco 'go-live'      (2) to test all (15+) transaction scenarios 'end to end' test.
A reminder of Aftab's email requesting your assistance is attached.
