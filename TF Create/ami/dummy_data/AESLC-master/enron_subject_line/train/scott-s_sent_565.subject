For October 19: Put the obsession and dedication back into your job,                      health, and daily life.
Stressful matters beyond your  control have leached away                      much of the excitement that makes life enjoyable.
Use  this Mercury retro                      period to reinvent your work philosophy and improve your  health and lifestyle.
The resources and relief you seek are available, but you  may be expected to                      kowtow and kiss butt to get what you need.
Are you  willing -- or not?
I can't
