Vladi,  as per our discussion today, Sprague and Enron are canceling our deal to buy 6,000 Dth Transco Z6 NY for 12/4-31/01 (Sprague buying from Enron).
Due to Enron's inability to deliver physical gas, Sprague will purchase supply from alternate suppliers.
You and I netted out physical deliveries for 12/1-3.
We will notify downstream LDC's not to accept any gas from Enron for us.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Thank you.
