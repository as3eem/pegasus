Vince  I manage the conference programme for Enron Europe and I have been co-ordinating Peter Styles' participation at Gas and PoweRisk, 6-8 November 2001.
With this taking place in Paris, I wanted to offer you our help should you require any assistance with liaison with the conference organiser, presentation support or hotel logistics.
Best regards
