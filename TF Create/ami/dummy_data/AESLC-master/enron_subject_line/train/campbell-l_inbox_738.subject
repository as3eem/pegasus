Dear Market Participant,  Technical Bulletin #67 - Automated Mitigation Procedure for the Day-Ahead Market - and Technical Bulletin #68 - Reference Level Adjustment Request Process - have been revised and will be posted to the NYISO web site.
Copies of the Technical Bulletins are attached for your convenience.
The purpose of our Technical Bulletins is to facilitate participation in the NYISO by communicating various NYISO concepts, techniques, and processes to Market Participants before they can be formally documented in a NYISO manual.
