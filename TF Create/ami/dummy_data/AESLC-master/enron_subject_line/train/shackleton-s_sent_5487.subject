All:  Do you need any of the ISDA "boilerplate" language ( the ISDA Master  Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex) to attach to the draft  Schedules/Paragraph 13 which we prepare to send to our counterparties?
We do  not have the "boilerplate" in a word document.
Also, is there anything that Houston legal can do to facilitate your  transactions?
