While our established schedules of Tuesday and Friday DPR's would have us reporting tomorrow's activity on Monday, we will change that for month end.
Please email the January 31st DPR information for your respective groups to my attention by noon on Friday.
You should use the same spreadsheet format used for the 1/29/02 DPR.
All p&l and PRMA numbers should be in $'000's.
Starting in February, you will be able to export the data, as opposed to using the spreadsheets.
Thanks,
