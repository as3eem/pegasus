I wanted to let you know that I sent you the TW Daily Balance report in Business Objects this afternoon.
When you get a chance, will you retrieve it and try to refresh it, please?
It may take a couple of minutes to refresh, so don't worry if it seems to be taking a long time.
By having the report yourself, we can start working on automating your imbalance monitoring process, or at the very least, we may be able to come up with a way to make the estimated imbalance on the report more accurate, as Tracy and Dan requested.
Let me know how it goes.
Thanks.
