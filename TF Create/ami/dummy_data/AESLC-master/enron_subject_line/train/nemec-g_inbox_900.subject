Hi Gerald,  I hope that things have gone well with your first set of law clerks.
I was writing to confirm that I will be starting work for you next Monday, July 2.
I have been trying to contact the HR representative that I spoke with initially, but she hasn't returned my calls.
I just wanted to make sure that everything was set for me to begin working.
I also wanted to let you know that I heard from the HBA about the photograph you recommended me for.
I wanted to thank you for remembering me.
I think that will be a great opportunity for me.
