Sara,  Have you been able to get any information on the corporate ownership of EFET.
ABN/AMRO requries this information to make decisions on the disposition of their trades with us.
Ideally, they would like a corporate org.
chart and balance sheet.
I am also going to contact Ted Murphy and Eric Shaw.
Thank you
