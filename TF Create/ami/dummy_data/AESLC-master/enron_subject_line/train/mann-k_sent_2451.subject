I didn't go back and check, but I believe the bills of sale or the  assignment/assumption agreement may help, as one of these should have the  serial number.
I think you may have a spread sheet that ties serial numbers  to unit numbers.
At least I hope so!
Let me know if this doesn't get you what you need.
