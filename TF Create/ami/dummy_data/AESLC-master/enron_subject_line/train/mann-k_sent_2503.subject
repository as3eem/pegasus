Here is one option.
The problem would be getting him picked up when I'm out  of town.
Charlotte might be able to help.
Also, there's the Presby church.
I wonder if SOTW has something.
He might enjoy a visit.
I just got to work and got my computer up and going.
Yes, the whole ordeal  was 1 1/2 hours.
