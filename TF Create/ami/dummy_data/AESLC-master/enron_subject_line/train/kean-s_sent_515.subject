Sandi deserves time off and she shouldn't have an obligation to do e-mail  while she is out.
Further,  I was only copying her on messages that many  others received (so I don't need to hear back from her).
But, if this is a  standard message going out to everyone while the fires continue to rage in  California, I think it leaves a bad impression.
Can we find a way to direct  urgent requests to someone else in the office or to someone on our external  lobby team?
