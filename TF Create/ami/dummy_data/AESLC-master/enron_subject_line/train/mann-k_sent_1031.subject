Deb,  Let's go ahead with POA's for Ben F. Jacoby for ENA, Tarheel Land  Development, Edgecombe Development, and Titan Land Development in accordance  with Janet's request and ENA standard practice.
Deb, I have the impression  that this is something you typically handle, although I'm glad to volunteer  Kathleen for the task if that would help.
There will be other companies, but we can add these as we go.
Kathleen,  please advise if there are any which you see as most active at this time.
For  instance, what are the names of the Florida development companies?
Your assistance is greatly appreciated, as Janet is eager to get this done.
Thanks,
