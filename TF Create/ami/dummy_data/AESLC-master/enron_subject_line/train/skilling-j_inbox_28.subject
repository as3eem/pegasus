Due to construction delays at the Houston Center  for Contemporary Craft, we are postponing the donor appreciation reception  (scheduled for May 2) until September.
We will let you know the  new date as soon as it is determined.
We are mailing a notice to all those invited  today.
Please call if you have any questions.
