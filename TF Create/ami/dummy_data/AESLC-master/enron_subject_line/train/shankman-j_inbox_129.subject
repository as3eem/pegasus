I am totally remiss!
I am only now sending  you the email you asked for with the breakdowns, etc.
The total sale was  $50,000, and I devised net prices as such:   KPM set: $25,000 Royal Copenhagen vase: $3,000 Mars Vallet bronze: $11,000 Rozenburg vase: $11,000   I've attached the original invoice for you as  well.
My Dear Jeff, I hope you are holding up through all  this shit that your company is putting you through and I am truly sorry that  it's happening to you.
You deserve a whole lot better than  this.
Love,
