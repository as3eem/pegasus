Robin,  Thanks for your call this morining.
As stated,  I am unaware of any changes  in our agreements or terms with regards to Canadian  companies or  transactions.
If  "Caraway" is the correct spelling,  I find no person by  that name in our credit departments.
Do you have a phone number for this guy?
Regards,
