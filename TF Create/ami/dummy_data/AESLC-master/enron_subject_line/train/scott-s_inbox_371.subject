I just wanted to clarify the purpose and file location of the "Progress Summaries".
These speadsheets are located at O:\CurveValidation\Estate Reporting\Gas.
There are a total of four tracking summaries, one for each region (East, West, Texas, Canada/Central).
Please update these documents as you validate each of the natural gas curves.
Thanks again for all of your help.
Regards,
