Many of you have asked to send an email when we launch.
I am pleased to let you know that ZapMedia officially launched its flagship product, the  ZapStation - a multimedia CD/DVD  player and digital music/movie jukebox, with unlimited Internet access and up-to-date news from the USATODAY - a precedent in the rapidly growing digital home entertainment space.
Below is an ad that appeared in the 11/14/01 Sports Section of the USATODAY, courtesy of our partners at Gannett.
You can also get more details at www.zapmedia.com.
