As you probably know, FERC yesterday issued an order that largely granted the joint complaint that was filed by Mirant and Reliant in regard to ISO's preferential treatment of CDWR.
Attached is a copy of the order, in which certain relevant passages from the order have been highlighted for your convenience.
I hope that you and your families all have a wonderful Thanksgiving!
