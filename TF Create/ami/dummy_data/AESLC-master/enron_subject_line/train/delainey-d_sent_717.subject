Matthew, if you know my reputation, I tend not to be a big fan of these type  of events either - however, at this point, I need to collect more information  on the event and I think it inappropriate to cancel at this late stage.
Going forward, I think we as a management team including yourself should  discuss what the strategy should be going forward.
Don't hesitate to voice your opinion.
