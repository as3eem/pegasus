Hi, Shane.
Here's a quick update.
As you can see, the Westpac ISDA is a  done deal.
Susan Bailey (paralegal) had been holding the Commonwealth ISDA  because she didn't have an address.
I asked her to email you for the info.
I am working on ABN AMRO.
I' m also trying to keep up with you other trading  activity.
Let me know if you ever have any questions.
Sara
