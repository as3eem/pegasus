market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Market Participants,  The virtual transaction software was implemented late yesterday afternoon for bidding into tomorrow's Day-Ahead Market.
While there were some connectivity problems with submission of virtual bids, those were solved yesterday evening and several Customers submitted virtual bids for evaluation.
Security Constrained Unit Commitment ran this morning, including the virtual transaction bids, and posted around 9:00 a.m.
