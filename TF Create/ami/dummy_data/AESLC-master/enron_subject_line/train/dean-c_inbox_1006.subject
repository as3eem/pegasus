Earlier today I sent copies of TXU's proposed 867_03 contingency plan for your review.
We will be prepared to discuss this proposal at the RMS workshop on Thursday.
We will also be prepared to discuss TXU's contingency plans for the 1.4 conversion.
Unfortunately, we may not be able to send out copies for your review prior to the meeting.
If that is the case, I will bring copies with me to the meeting.
