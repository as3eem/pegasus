In a conversation with Randy Miller of Texla, the following credit issues  were raised:  1.
Texla would like to raise their threshold to $200,000; 2.
In place of a LC  Texla would offer furture trades  within 24 hours.
As previously discussed, I can write the language, the decision is a credit   call.
