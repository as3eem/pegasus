Oops.
Can you forward my response to Margaret to her.
I sent it to you by misstake.
Tom     Tom-   I read the e-mail Margaret and you wrote to each other.
It does not really matter, but just so you know, the situation I was talking about the private room was for my Mom not my Grandmother.
It was at Vosswood after her surgery.
