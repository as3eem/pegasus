Tom or Phillip,  Deal #537939 (Dec-00 purchase from Shell Western E&P) is being invoiced from Coral Energy Resources.
I assume that since this the only deal in the system for that month with SWEPI, Coral is correct.
Therefore, please review / change this deal from SWEPI to Coral Energy Resources, L.P.
Please let me know of any questions or when this change is complete.
Thank you,
