Dear PIRA Client,  PIRA has created a new slide presentation on the U.S. economy.
You can access this presentation via PIRA Online (www.pira.com) by logging in and choosing "US Economy" from the new "Macro Data" drop-down menu at the top of the screen.
The table of contents is listed below.
Given the overall importance of U.S. economic trends and their impact on local and international energy markets, PIRA maintains and analyzes a database of key economic indicators.
This effort supports our ongoing analyses of energy supply/demand fundamentals and the associated market forecasts.
This slide presentation - which will be updated as new data become available - is being made available complimentarily to all PIRA clients to support their own analyses.
Gary N. Ross Chief Executive Officer PIRA Energy Group
