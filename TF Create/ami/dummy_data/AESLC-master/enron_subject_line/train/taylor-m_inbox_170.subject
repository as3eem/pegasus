I had a good visit with her on the issues.
She advised that she is on a task force to add amendments to the revised 9 in Delaware and thought the group might entertain favorably an exception for master netting agreements from the anti-restriction/assignment receivable issue.
She will work on this for us if we want her to.
I think we should--at least it would be a start and an example.
Do you think there would be great risk in applying Delaware law to the master netting agreements rather than New York?
Let's talk.
Call me Monday.
