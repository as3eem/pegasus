Hi.
I just wanted to let you know that the conference I was going to attend in Austin next week was cancelled and the organizers of the conference are now defunct.
Oh well.....I think I'll pass on going to Austin for the game.
I need a weekend at home to myself after SC and the Vegas/Grand Canyon adventure.
Did you enjoy the long weekend?
