John, Attached for your review is the process that I am pursuing at Mariner.
I would like to discuss it with you tomorrow if you are available in person or by phone.
Also, it appears that Mariner has another discovery in its Swordfish prospect.
The results from the 1st well are positive and we are preparing to drill the 2nd well in the next few days.
Second well will be down around Christmas.
A definitive economic impact is impossible to provide at this point but could be in the $15-$25 million range +.
