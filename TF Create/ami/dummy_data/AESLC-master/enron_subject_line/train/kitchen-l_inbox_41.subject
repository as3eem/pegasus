Liz and Tammie:  Mark Haedicke requested I get two different dates that Greg and Louise can be available to meet with the CFTC here in Houston.
The CFTC will come to review our operations and ensure we are operating in compliance with the law.
Mark has proposed to block out and hold Thursday, February 21, and Thursday, February 28.
Then we can submit those two dates to the folks at the CFTC and see which date they prefer.
Please advise if we can hold those two dates.
Many thanks.
