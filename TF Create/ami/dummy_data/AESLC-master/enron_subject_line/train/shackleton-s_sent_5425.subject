Sylvia:  Shortly Samantha Boyd will email to you two documents:  Enron North America  Corp.'s final form of guaranty with most of your requested changes (the "ENA  Guaranty") and a comparison of your guaranty markup against the ENA  Guaranty.
I am hopeful that this will be satisfactory for purposes of the  deal at hand.
Let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Thanks.
Sara
