I met with the Research team responsible for building a model for EES and ran through the model.
The model can be used to value ERCOT deals or at least we can use it as a benchmark for pricing.
I have attached a document that summarizes what EES is using the model to price, and how we can use it to price our deals.
I am out tomorrow but will be back in the office Wed. morning.
Research is looking at historical ERCOT prices and customer load data (TXI).
I will set up a meeting on Wednesday to further discuss the model and other issues associated with deal valuation.
Call me on my cell if you need to reach me, (832) 275-8212     Regards
