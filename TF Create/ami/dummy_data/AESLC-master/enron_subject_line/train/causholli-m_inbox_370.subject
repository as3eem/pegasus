Dear Team,  Advance Publications' The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., is struggling to find $10 million to slash from its budget because many of its key retail advertisers have filed for bankruptcy or cut their spending.
The Star-Ledger still promises to honor its famous handbook pledge not to lay off any of its nonunion employees due to a bad turn in the economy.
The Star-Ledger also canceled its Christmas party, has closed a small satellite office in Newark, is offering buyouts to selected employees, and will decrease the amounts of its annual raises and bonuses.
The Star-Ledger has a  410,547-weekday-circulation newspaper and about 132,449 MT in newsprint consumption.
The carnage continues as the loss of advertising dollars plagues newspapers.
