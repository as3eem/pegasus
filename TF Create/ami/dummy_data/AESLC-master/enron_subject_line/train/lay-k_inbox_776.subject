Ken,   My line manager in London was Steven Roselius.
He  is a good guy with a family and a loyal company man.
He is a Texan and over in  London on a two year contract.
Now he has just rented his house out in Houston  on a six month contract so has no where to live and no job.
He has lost 100K in  Enron stock.
If you can offer him any help please do so, he is under a lot of  stress which he is taking quietly.
Regards,
