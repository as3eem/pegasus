Effective today, Northern Border is lifting a firm-only restriction on its 42-inch Monchy/Port of Morgan to Ventura segment.
The constraint had been implemented Wednesday due to compressor station outages upstream of Ventura.
El Paso Field Services has scheduled its annual maintenance shutdown of the Waha Plant for Oct. 7-12.
Fourteen gathering systems will be shut in.
Capacity of the San Juan Crossover will remain restricted to 570 MMcf/d until repairs are completed on an air leak in the Lincoln Station's turbine, El Paso said.
