Carol:  Here's another paper & pulp master with a relatively new deal person (Steve  Klein).
The file has sat for ages and it looks like outside counsel has some  time (he's a good guy).
Please let me know.
Also, I spoke with Mark and I'd like to sit down with you to do some  brainstorming/planning, e.g., a group offsite, in-house training, form  changes.
Today is not a good day but tomorrow is fine.
How about 2 pm?
