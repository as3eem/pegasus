Calpine Eastern Corporation, Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P., Mirant New England, LLC, Mirant Kendall, LLC, and Mirant Canal, LLC filed a complaint against ISO New England with respect to its unilateral modification of Market Rule 5 and Appendix 5-C of the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) FERC Electric Rate Schedule No.
6, through which ISO-NE has excluded external energy contracts from its calculation of the Energy Clearing Price since September 1, 2001.
Interventions in this proceeding are due this week; please let me know immediately whether we have a specific interest.
In any event, I will circulate an update of any FERC action on the complaint.
