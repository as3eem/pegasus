Kathy,  My recollection is the costs to us were roughly:  Scenario 1				$55m 2 week for service 2 weeks for $10k in pay Min 8 weeks max 52  Scenario 2				$45m 1.5 weeks 1.5 weeks Min 8 max 39  Scenario 3				$35m Dynegy 2 weeks Min 13 weeks max 52  I've pitched the following compromise to Dynegy this morning:  2 weeks for service 2 weeks for every $10k of salary capped at $100k Min 13 weeks max 52 weeks.
Can you run numbers and correct above if I'm way off.
Thanks
