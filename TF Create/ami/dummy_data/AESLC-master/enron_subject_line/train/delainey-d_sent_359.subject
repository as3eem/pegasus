Tim, I thought I would send you a copy of the East Mid-Market QBR to give you  a view on what Presto/Baughman are doing.
The West historically has been far  better than the East in covering the market and generating mid market  deals/services.
I look forward to our discussion in Portland next week.
I  would like to get a perspective on organization, market approach, deal flow,  resources, products and coverage for the Mid-Market group at that meeting.
Regards
