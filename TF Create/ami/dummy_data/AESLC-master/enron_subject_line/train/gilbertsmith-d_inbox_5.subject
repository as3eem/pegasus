Attached is the agenda as well as the documentation for the TX SET meeting on 2/12 at the Comfort Suites (directly across the parking lot from the ERCOT MET Center).
The meeting will begin promptly at 9:30 AM and will adjourn at 4:00 PM - we have an extremely robust agenda so plan your travel accordingly.
Please RSVP by COB Friday (2/8), to Christine Meloro (cmeloro@newpower.com) as well as Terri Waggoner (twaggoner@ercot.com).
Hope to see you all next Tuesday!
