Attached is a list containing the new MG counterparties.
You can see it by  clicking on the second tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet  where it  says "MG New Cpys".
Ignore the first tab.
I am told by London Legal that  our deadline for responding to this list is Monday.
Bandwidth team, in talking to London Legal, per my current understanding, the  only two jurisdictions approved to trade bandwidth are the US and UK.
We've  got Japan and Bermuda approved to trade US segment only.
So unless we hear  otherwise from you, it is our intention to give all the other counterparties  "read only" access.
