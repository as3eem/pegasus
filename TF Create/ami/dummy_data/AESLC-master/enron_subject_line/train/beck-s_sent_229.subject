I am not trying to twist any arms with this question, but is there anything  we can do so that Jody can make the presentation at OU?
Since he was the top  graduate from the Energy Management Program at OU, it would be great for him  to be at the presentation next Tuesday night.
I know that recruiting events  can be a drain on staffing, but it is also time well spent.
I do know that  Jody is in a role that has real day-to-day commitments, so if there is not a  feasible way to have someone calc a book for him I will understand.
I just  wanted you to take a look at this.
Thanks.
