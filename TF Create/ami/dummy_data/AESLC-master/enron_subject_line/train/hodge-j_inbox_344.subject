Hello, I am looking for supply for two facilities in Ohio.
The first is located behind COH 7-3 and the second facility is located behind COH 5-2.
They are looking for firm supply to their respective gates.
I have attached their load profile below.
I am looking for a Nymex plus applicable basis quote.
Please let me know if you are able to bid on one if not both facilities.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Sincerely,
