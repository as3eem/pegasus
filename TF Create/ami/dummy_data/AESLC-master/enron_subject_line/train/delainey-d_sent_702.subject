Thanks Chris - I assume you are speaking about credit risk on the thirty day  deal when you refer to the $2M exposure on $100 - has Tim spoken to John  about this?
I am supportive of this proposal and approach.
Like our  discussion, we have to find a way to be supportive to the re-development of  this market without creating un-acceptable credit or market losses.
We also  have to support Lay's efforts in California.
