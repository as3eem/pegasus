Guys, have we started the mobilization on the tear-down of the two 501FD's at  Gleason?
Will they be machining the equipment on site - it appears to me  that we should not let that equipment leave the site if possible.
Do we have  a credible site rep from Westinghouse for both Wheatland and Gleason?
Please advise.
Thanks
