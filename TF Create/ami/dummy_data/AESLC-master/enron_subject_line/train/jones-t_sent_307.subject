Taffy, can you check Grant's list against our list of executed masters for  ECT Canada.
The Canada office is missing some of the masters we have in  place, and we have to provide them copies.
See me and I'll show you how to  do a sort on Lotus Notes to figure out what executed masters we show Canada  has in place, vs. the masters they think they have in place.
Thanks!
