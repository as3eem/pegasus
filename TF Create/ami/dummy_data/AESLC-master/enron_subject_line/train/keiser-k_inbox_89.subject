Are there any more revisions for the Power Books.
We are going to put together a list of all books to date with all revisions sent to us as of yesterday.
Once this is put together, we will send to each of you to ensure complete accuracy, therefore, any revisions that we may have should be caught on the list following later today.
Again, let me know of any other revisions we may have.
Thanks.
John
