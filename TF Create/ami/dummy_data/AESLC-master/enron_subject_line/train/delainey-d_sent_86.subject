Chris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues  for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call  regardless of the hit.
Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be  worthwhile.
Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you  are doing the right thing.
