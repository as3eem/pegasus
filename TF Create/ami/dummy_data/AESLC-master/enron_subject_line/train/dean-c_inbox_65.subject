Here is the link to the T&D Model.

Apparently you have to do individual INS requests through your IT group, in order to gain access to this drive and folder.
If you have any questions regarding the inputs or outputs of the model, please call or email Ken Farrar.
He is the one who developed it.
Thanks.
