We have just decided to divide the western region into two groups.
I will be heading up the Rockies/NW and Northern California, while Phillip Allen heads up the Southwest and Southern California.
Think about whether or not you  would like to change how you serve our groups going forward.
We will need to divide the curve files to reflect the separate regions.
The Southwest will be defined as EP SJ and EP Permian.
P&L summary reports will be separated into two groups.
