Jim and Rex:  The Lehman Bros. form of "put" works fine from a legal perspective.
Yesterday, I faxed to you one of the "puts" with underlined language  reflecting differences in securities language from our prior swap/forward  deals with Lehman.
The differences may be alright for purposes of the "puts".
Please let Jeff know if the "puts" are acceptable for execution (from the  securities perspective).
I have already initialed the documents from the  swap perspective.
Let me know if you have any questions.
As usual, thanks for your help.
