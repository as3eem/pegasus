PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION  As we said in our initial meetings with you, it is very important that you preserve your records relating to Enron.
Attached is a letter we received from one of the plaintiffs' lawyers requesting that we preserve all documents relating to Enron.
We have already responded to the letter, but we are passing it on to you because, despite its tone, it provides a useful outline of the types of records you should preserve and the places where such documents might be found.
Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions.
