Tanya:  After the last meeting, I promised to ask you about the following:  (1)  Nova Scotia Power Inc. - this shows up as "credit review".
Should this  remain on the list and if so, is there anything that legal needs to do?
(2)  Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. - this is the new "Forest Oil" of the  list so I say let's forget it.
No, seriously, Carol did revisit the latest  draft and said it was pared down about as far as it could go.
Further, she  cannot get anyone at Occidental to return phone calls.
Please let me know what you would like to do.
