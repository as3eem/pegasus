Tanya:  Enron Corp. has a 1/17/92 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange master wtih  Paribas.
I will fax to you the letter which I received regarding the above  merger.
Basically, Enron Corp.'s signature to this letter will indicate  agreement to put all [existing, if any, and future] Transactions under this  master but with all obligations becoming those of the surviving entity which  is BNP and which changed its name to "BNP Paribas."
Do you have any credit issues?
Sara
