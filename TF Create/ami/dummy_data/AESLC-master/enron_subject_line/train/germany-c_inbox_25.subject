This  project is expected to take seven days to complete.
The only location to be impacted by this project is 4119 - AEP/Equitable  Storage.
This location is impacted because it is solely connected to Line 300.
While this work is being performed, CGT will be unable to accept nominations  for delivery to or receipt from this location.
A revised notice will be posted once the work has been completed and CGT is  able to resume accepting nominations for this location.
