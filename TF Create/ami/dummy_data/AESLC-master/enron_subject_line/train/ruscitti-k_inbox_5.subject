Stacy,  Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for EOL.
I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 2000.
Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.
Also, will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?
Thanks,
