Mark,   The traders at enovate in the Chicago office would like to be able to use the  ICE system.
I understand that you are the person who should review these  agreements.
If you are not the right person, please let me know.
I am  sending a second e-mail that goes with this one.
Feel free to call me for  any additional information that you might need.
Stacy
