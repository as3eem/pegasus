We  are shocked and distressed beyond words at the cowardly  terrorist  attack on innocent Americans.
Our  prayers  are for your well  being  and that of all Americans .
This is a quick  mail to tell you  that we are thinking of you at this   moment and praying for your well being while condemning this act of  depravity.
(ASHWANI  KUMAR)
