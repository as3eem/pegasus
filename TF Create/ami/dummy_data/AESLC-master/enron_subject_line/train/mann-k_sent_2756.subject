Hi Randy,  Here's what you missed.
My personal preference is to not spend the money to check out the licensing  issues at this point since I don't have the outside counsel doing anything  now.
When John called me last week and asked the question I gave him that  opinion, and I had assumed that it had been communicated to you.
Sorry about  that!
Kay
