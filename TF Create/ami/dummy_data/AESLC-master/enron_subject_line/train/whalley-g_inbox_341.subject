Greg, I have been a dedicated Enron employee for two years.
I was originally part of the Research group and now work for EIM Fundamentals.
This is a very difficult and exciting time both  for our company and for me as an employee.
I would like to be more involved in this process.
Does your office currently have ANY type of position where I can make most contribution to the company.
Thank you,
