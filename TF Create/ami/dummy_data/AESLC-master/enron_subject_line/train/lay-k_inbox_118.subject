I have received all of your responses regarding the board meetings at The Huntingdon.
The first meeting will be held on Wednesday, June 20, 2001, at 4:30 p.m., at The Huntingdon in the Management Office.
I am sending this email to confirm the meeting in Dr. Butler's absence.
I am sure that the other board dates will be firmed up at that meeting.
Please call me if there are any questions.
Thank you.
Diane
