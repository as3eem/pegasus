Hi Jim,  In response to your voice mail message, please know that you remain our first choice to chair the new Institute.
As long as you are still eager and able to lead it, we want you.
Please let me know if the e-memo below needs to be revised in any way.
Upon your approval, I'll shoot it right out.
Thanks.
