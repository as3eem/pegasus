Hi Sally,   Do you know where we stand with the Enron America's changes?
I presume the Operations people are working with the business people and will then get with the IT people once decision have been made ?
Are we done with EES, I heard that Fallon is going to speak to Whalley about their position (i.e.
no changes).
Are there more questions to ask the EGM/EIM busineses, are these being asked ?
Can you send me the spreadsheet we put together.
Thanks
