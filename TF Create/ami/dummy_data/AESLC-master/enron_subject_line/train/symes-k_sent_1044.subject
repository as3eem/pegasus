Les - I received this list from the Confirms group this morning.
Looks like they  need quite a few unit names for confirmation purposes.
But if I remember  correctly, you didn't want these deals confirmed.
Please let me know when you  get a chance, and I can go through and either change them to "no confirm" or  add the unit names.
Thanks,
