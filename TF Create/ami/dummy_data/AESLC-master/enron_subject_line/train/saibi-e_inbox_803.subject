Dear All:  The last 3 yrs.
that I have spent at Enron have been extremely enjoyable, challenging and interesting.
I would like to thank you all for contributing to making the time I spent here memorable.
I have made some really good friends and I would like to stay in touch with all of you.
Because I am not sure what the the future holds I have attached my lifetime e-mail address below.

Thank you for the memories
