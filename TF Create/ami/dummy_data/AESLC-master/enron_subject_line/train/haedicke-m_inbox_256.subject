Mark,   I wanted to let you know that today will be my last day at Enron.
Please remove me from all the boards.
I have really enjoyed working with you and my time at Enron.
I still can't believe all that has happened.
Best of luck to you and your family and I hope we get a chance to work together again someday.
Sincerely,
