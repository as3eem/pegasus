A huge debate has been ongoing in he battle whether to include language in  the EEI Contract that would provide that a confirmation that contains  "substantive" terms not discussed by the traders is subject to the "deemed  accepted" language.
I have been very vocal against  adding this language.
The politics as you can tell from this email have been fierce, and as in much  of successful politics, dirty.
I'm not sure where this will end up, but feel  like it is important that we all are aware of the history here as well as  Enron's position (Confirmation needs to be the final, best evidence unless  objected to in a timely manner).
I will keep everybody posted on the results  of the vote.
