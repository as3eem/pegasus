There are no changes...
There will be no substantial heat in California  this week.
In fact, temperatures wil actually average below normal for  Monday-Wednesday before warming at the end of the week.
Although there is some  possibility of above to much above normal temperatures in California and the  Desert Southwest, it seems more likely that at least a partial start to the  monsoon thunderstorms will occur.
Since the normal high is 104 in Phoenix, I  would opt for 1-2 degrees above normal as an average for the week.
The Pacific Northwest will see below normal  temperatures for the next 10-14 days on average.
Above normal precipitation for the time of  year...   Dave
