I look forward to seeing you Thursday evening, February 15, at the Texas  Public Policy Foundation ("TPPF") event, "A Farewell Evening with Lady  Margaret Thatcher."
Wendy Gramm, who serves on our Board, is the Chairman of  the Board of the TPPF.
The TPPF is a state research institute guided by the  core principles of limited government, free enterprise, private property  rights and individual responsibility.
TPPF is similar in many respects to  the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., but focuses on state issues.
Below are the pertinent details for the event.
Please call Rebecca Carter  (x3-7241) or Sherri Sera (x3-5984) if you have any questions.
