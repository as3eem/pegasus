Hello, I just wanted to say I hope your weekend  went well.
Payton is growing like a weed.
He is now tickalish.
He also has learned how to scream, now that's about all he does.
He has a  walker and he loves to sit in it and just talk away.
He is such a happy  baby, everyone enjoys him and loves to see him, he's so pleasant.
