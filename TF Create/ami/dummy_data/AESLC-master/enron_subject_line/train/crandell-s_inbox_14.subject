At Jim Steffes request, I have assembled a matrix of the status of current emerging RTOs/standard markets in North America.
Sarah, could you look at the "next steps" and let me know if I missed anything major?
Also, does any body know if EPSA or some other organization is maintaining a similar overview database.
(FERC's site is out of date).
I will keep the latest version of this on the 0:\public affairs\RTO information database directory.
