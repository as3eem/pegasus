Torrey,  Rob Benson is currently trading two general power regions (PJM and New York) under one EOL ID.
He manages one stack manager of which all deals are mapped to his EPMI-LT-PJM book.
He would like to create an additional stack manager so that he can divide the two regions into their own stack and manage them on separate screens.
All of the deals would continue to go into the LT-PJM book.
Let me know if this would be doable and what I need to do on my side to help out.
Thanks!
