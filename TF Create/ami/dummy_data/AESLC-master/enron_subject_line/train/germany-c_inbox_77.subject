Kay,  I am trying to track down any information that may be in Legal's files on the JM Huber producer netback transaction.
My guess is that it would be either Jeff Hodge's or Gerals Nemec's files.
This deal was done by the deal makers in ENA's Denver Office.
I believe that the decision to assume or reject the Wyoming Interstate Company transportation capacity might impact the settlement of the JM Huber deal9s).
Thanks for your help,
