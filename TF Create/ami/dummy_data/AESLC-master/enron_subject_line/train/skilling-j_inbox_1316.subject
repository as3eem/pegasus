All:  Ken Rice has suggested that we schedule an evening to get together in the near future.
Sherri and I have determined that earliest date would be the first week of October.
Please let me know your availability the first two weeks of October and I'll get this scheduled.
The attendees would be:  Jeff Skilling/Sherri Sera Ken Rice/Dorothy Dalton Kevin Hannon/Carol Brown Cliff Baxter/Susan Skarness  Please note:  this e:mail address will only work through next Monday (9/10/01) after that date, please reply to ddalton34@aol.com.
