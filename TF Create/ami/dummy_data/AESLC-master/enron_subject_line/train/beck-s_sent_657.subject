I know that over the past few weeks you have been handling your daily  responsibilities and working on the transition of business from our  aquisition of CES's wholesale business.
I realize that balancing all of this  has been demanding, especially with the holidays, bid week and other end of  year actitivies.
Thank you for the extra effort that you have given to  effectively absorb the CES book of business.
It is noticed and appreciated.
As we look forward to the new year, I thank you for your accomplishments and
