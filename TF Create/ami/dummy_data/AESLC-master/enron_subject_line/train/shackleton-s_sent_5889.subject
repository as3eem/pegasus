Maria:  I was waiting to see if Jason Peters ever sent a "position letter" to you  when we brought this negotiation back inhouse.
Absent that information, it  appears that we had at least one issue remaining and it concerned the  disruption fallbacks, in particular, your request for both you and ENA to  each obtain two quotes and then average those quotes (the ultimate  fallback).
We cannot agree to your request.
The last database entry I  reflect was in October, 2000, when we were having difficulty obtaining your  response.
Given the lapse of time, we could try to generate a blackline and review the  status.
Please let me know what you would like to do.
