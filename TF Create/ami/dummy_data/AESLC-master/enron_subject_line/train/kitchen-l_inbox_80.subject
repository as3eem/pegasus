Dear Louise,  I hope everything is well at your end.
Given the fact that UBS seems be the buyer of the Enron trading part in the US I was wondering if you think it is worthwhile to think about (or discuss) an extension to Europe (or the Netherlands in particular).
I am currently still employed by Enron although we are currently in the process of closing down the Enron Amsterdam office (I therefore attached my private contact details).
Best regards,
