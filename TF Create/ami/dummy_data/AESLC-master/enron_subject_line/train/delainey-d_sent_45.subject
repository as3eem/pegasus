Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.
Over the years,  it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers.
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is  questionable.
I vote to kill it.
Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with  my partners.
Regards
