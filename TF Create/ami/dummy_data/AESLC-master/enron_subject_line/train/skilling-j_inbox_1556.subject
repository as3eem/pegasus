Boys,     At the risk of him saying "It's no big deal fellas", I need to notify you that Brother John Grumbles, will be undergoing exploratory heart surgery via the ole catheter up the leg procedure sometime very soon.
The Drs.
are telling him he's most likely got a partially clogged artery at the bottom of his heart and if he does, they will proceed with the angioplasty procedure at the same time.
Dr. Fullerton has already contacted him as have several of us local guys and I think IT IS A BIG DEAL and I know he would appreciate a call.
The surgery was actually scheduled for a couple of days ago but was cancelled at the last minute because of a doctor screw up.
His phone number is 972 617-2412.
Nothing like a big dose of -kai-when
