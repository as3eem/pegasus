The address list on the memo below contains the names of all ENA Energy  Operations employees who worked in the offices in Houston, Denver and Calgary  on January 1st to test our systems.
Does it work for you to copy and paste  this for Cliff's note?
Let me know if it would be better to provide this to  you in a different way.
Thanks.
