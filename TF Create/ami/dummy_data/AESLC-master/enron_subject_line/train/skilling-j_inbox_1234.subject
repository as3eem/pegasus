We have combined everyone's input and here is where we are thus far.
We are targeting Friday, 9/21 for mail out of the invitations.
The initial invitation will not have the steering committee members listed, due to timing of the mail out.
A second mail out is scheduled for two weeks prior to the event.
The second mail out will include the steering committee members.
please forward your comments to my attention as soon as possible.
Thank you for your input,
