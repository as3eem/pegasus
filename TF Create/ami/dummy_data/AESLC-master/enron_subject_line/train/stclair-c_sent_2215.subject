Janet: Enclosed is some sample surety bond language that we have used along with a  surety bond form.
I have reviewed your form and think that we can use it  with some minor modifications.
The enclosed provisions will need to be  modified to fit our situation and taht is part of what I want to discuss at  our meeting next week so we can all understand how the bond gets issued, what  it covers and how it gets triggered.
I look forward to seeing you next  Thursday.
