We are planning to hold another informal lunch this coming Friday in  Conference Room 38C2 from 12-1:30 to go over in more depth how the ISDA  Master and ISDA Credit Support Annex works.
If you are interested in  attending, could you please contact my assistant, Suzanne Adams at 37340  TODAY so that she can get a head count for lunch.
Thanks and sorry about the  short notice.
