Here is the spreadsheet which lists all of the existing counterparties  proposed to receive access to the online trading system.
Louise has asked us  to identify for each counterparty those products from which, for legal  reasons, such counterparty should be restricted.
As you might expect, our  goal is to have as few restrictions as possible.
Since it is so wide, you may find that it is easier to modify the spreadsheet  (by hiding various columns) in order to print it out.
If you need any help  in this regard, please let me know.
