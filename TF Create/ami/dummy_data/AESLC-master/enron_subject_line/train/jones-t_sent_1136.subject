Attached is a list of Japanese counterparties.
I need to respond to  EnronOnline Friday with my approvals to this list.
The list is broken up  into 3 groups, Group 1 being counterparties already opened up for online  trading (so you don't need to re-review), Group 2 being counterparties that  we have correct names and credit on (you need to review this list which has  about 100 counterparties), and Group 3 being counterparties that we have bad  names or no approved credit yet ( so you don't need to approve this list).
You may ask, what products will these counterparties trade?
They can  potentially trade all the products we offer online so you need to look at  them like any new counterparty.
Saying that, what we really expect them to  trade is the Singapore based group of products.
