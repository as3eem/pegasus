hi there: how are you doing?
have you told the company anything yet?
i am thinking you probably had to turn ole pattie down... was she devestated that you won't be her new BFF?
let me know how it went, and i hope things are going well on the whole "looking for a job" front.
I know it can be so frustrating.
have you spoken with matt????
any more updates with that?
happy valentines (even though it is a dumb holiday)  Take care bonnie
