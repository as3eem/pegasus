Dear Dr. Ken Lay -  	It was my pleasure to meet you during the WCS cermony in New York earlier this year during which Enron received the award for the work we have done in Bolivia with the WCS and other NGOs.
During a staff call today in my group the rumor of the potential cancellation of the offsite in San Antonio was mentioned.
Hopefully this rumor is nothing more than that - a rumor.
During the time of crises the transmittal of information is critical.
Furthermore having the Enron management at the VP and above level bought into the way forward for the company is a must for the continued success of the company.
