By telefax of November 21, Uriel Dutton of F&J provided a proposed waiver letter agreement for our review.
I will have copies of that proposed agreement circulated by hand-delivery and fax to all those on this list and to Mariner's GC.
At present,  I am not sending this e-mail to Mariner's GC.
If there is someone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.
Chuck and I have reviewed the letter, believe it to be overly broad, and hope that F&J is willing to negotiate further, along the following lines:  	1.
On page 1, third full paragraph, second line, we suggest inserting "Enron Corp. and " between "representation of" and "Enron's affiliates".
