Nancy,  I've discovered a basis book with the attribute problem we corrected for the  Physical book below.
INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS was set up to replace IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  for credit purposes.
However, the correct region code is still being applied  to the old book.
Here's what I need to happen.
BOOK ID   CURRENT REGION CODE  CORRECT REGION CODE  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS MIDWEST    MDWEST  IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  MDWEST    MDWEST_OLD (This region code really doesn't matter  as long as it does not                               duplicate a currently  used region code.)
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks for your help,
