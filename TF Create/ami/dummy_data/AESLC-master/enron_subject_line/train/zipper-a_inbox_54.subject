I just wanted to let everyone know our time line with respect to NGX:  May 31st - Press release to the industry that Enron's information will be included in the NGX Index starting July 1st, 2001 (Rob Milnthorp).
June 15th - Enron systems are in place to transfer data to NGX (Andy Zipper & Jay Web).
June 30th - NGX is tested and ready to go.
