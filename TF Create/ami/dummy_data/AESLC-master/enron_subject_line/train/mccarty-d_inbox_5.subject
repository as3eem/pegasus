Pam:  Please note that Dave Neubauer requested to move from the 39th floor to EB1354.
The EB1354 office is empty and ready for move-in.
Danny has approved the move and the location on the 39th floor has been challenging for Dave in regards to administrative assistance and when staff/employees are trying to locate him.
Please advise when we schedule Dave for a move.
It would be preferred to wait until Linda returns from vacation (week of October 19th) so we can properly handle the move.
If you have any questions, please call me at x33597.
Thanks.
