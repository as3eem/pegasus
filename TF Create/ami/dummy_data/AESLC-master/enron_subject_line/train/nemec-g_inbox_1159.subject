As you know, we are continuously updating the Foreign & Domestic Counsel database so that it can be maintained in the most accurate form; therefore, any new information you may have regarding outside counsel firms that have been interviewed and/or retained in the past month would be greatly appreciated.
Also, if you have any updates to the existing database entries we would also like to hear from you.
Please take the time to help us update this database so it can be a valuable tool for all of us!
Each one of us has full access to the database via your Lotus Notes application at ECT_HOULN1/ECT/Legal/ECT Foreign & Domestic Counsel database.
We are also looking for any firms that have been either interviewed or have signed an Engagement Letter with us.
Please provide any new information and/or updates either to Nony Flores or Becky Spencer.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
