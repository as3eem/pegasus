7/20, HLH, 19MW:  BPA C#23634-EPMI-MORGAN-PINW-CPS-PPLM-SNOH(T)BPAP/HTSP #96092NF-PPLM PPLM failed to buy the transmission for Friday.
This path will go real-time.
Our real-time just needs to monitor and make sure PPLM gets the tranny purchased and calls it in to BPA in a timely manner.
The Saturday path is fine.
Thanks.
