Attached are the repurchase of the Foundation's  assigned partnership interest in two separate funds established by brothers late  last year.
The assets in both of the partnerships consisted of CDs, Treasuries  and cash both at the time of the assignment and the repurchase.
Since I am  transmitting these memos electronically, you may response your  approval/disapproval with a reply to this email or fax your copy to me.
If you  have any questions about either of these repurchases, please give me a  call.
