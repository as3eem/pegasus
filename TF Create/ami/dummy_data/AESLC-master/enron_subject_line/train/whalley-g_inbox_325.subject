Greg,  I know that you have more challeging issues than Mariner to consume your time; however, I wanted to advise you that I believe that we have at least made some short term gains at the company.
First, we have reduced the workforce by about 20%.
I will know before year end if further reductions are needed.
Second, we have sold 100% of Mariner's interest in Aconcagua for $51 million.
Originally, Mariner intended to sell 50% of its interest.
Expectations were $35-$40 million (100%).
Allan brought in the buyer
