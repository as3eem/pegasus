Sean,  I am sending this note to request that the correct counterparty name be confirmed on the 2 below puchase deals for Sep/01 production.
We are being invoiced by Coral Energy Canada Inc., whereas we have these deals in the system under Coral Energy Resources, L.P.
I cannot find executed confirmations on these deals.
Vladi Pimenov may be the trader or risk contact for these deals.
Please advise or change as necessary.
