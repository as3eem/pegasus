It looks like your Deal Blotter settings may be defaulting to PST time zone.
But these April deals need to flow during the PDT time zone.
Could you check  your settings and make sure the time zone defaults to PPT (that way the  strips will choose PST or PDT accordingly)?
Two additional deals were changed to the correct time zone: 534074 534072 534071 534053  Thanks,
