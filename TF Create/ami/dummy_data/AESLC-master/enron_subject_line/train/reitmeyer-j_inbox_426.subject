Hey Jay,  Just wanted to let you know that I resigned from Enron yesterday and took my job back at Wilkens Weather.
No, just kidding -with Energy USA over in the Galleria area.
They are a smaller, less sexier and more conservative company than Enron but then we all know what can happen to a "sexy" company.
