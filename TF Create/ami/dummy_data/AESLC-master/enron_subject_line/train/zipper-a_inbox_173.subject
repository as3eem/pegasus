Andy:   Would you please look into this structure.
The intention is to price the structure at the money.
The time when they started - the basis diff was 25 cents.
I propose to price it as shown below and one at NGI SoCal border minus  IFERC San Juan minus  market price.
I have included the LAX (Los Angeles Airport) weather data summary for your info.
Please call me if you need additional information.
Thanks,
