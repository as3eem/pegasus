Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key violations as well.
These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key violation):  458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR 611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001) 608 NOVELTY HILL M/S 612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001)  If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be great.
If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.
Thanks,
