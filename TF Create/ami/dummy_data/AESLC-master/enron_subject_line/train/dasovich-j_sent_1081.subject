Rick:  Just want to let you know that I missed the boat a bit in coordinating my  reviewers with Paul.
In my first attempt to input them in the system, I  hesitated including you for the simple reason that I'm certain you have  countless other reviews to do already, and, frankly, I feel that you're an  integral part of my review whether you're formally on the list or not.
When  I went back to make my final additions to the list, the systerm was already  closed--Paul had approved the first round, which I guess shuts it down.
