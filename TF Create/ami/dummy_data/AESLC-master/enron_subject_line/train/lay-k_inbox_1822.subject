Ken -   Although I cannot pretend to feel the pressure you have felt over the past year, I do appreciate your interest in the employees as expressed in the current decision regarding the Change of Control Provision.
In light of the current circumstances, it is an honorable action.
I wouldn't be here (4 yrs; as an Analyst, then and currently an Associate) if I didn't believe in Enron and would have left long ago.
Enron has had a profound impact in more than the energy sector, and will continue regardless of Enron's form, simply based on its historical innovation.
To have our health and have had the opportunity to do what Enron has done is astonishing, especially these days.
I wish you the best in time ahead.
Be well, Ilan
