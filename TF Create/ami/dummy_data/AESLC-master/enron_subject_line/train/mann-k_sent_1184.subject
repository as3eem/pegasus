Kathleen,  We have forms for confidentiality agreements.
All CA's are processed through  Kay Young, as she maintains the data base.
Kay, could you point Kathleen to  the repository of the forms so that she can generate the first draft?
By the  way, I've assembled the emails I received on changing the form.
I'll be  happy to take a crack at the revisions if you tell me which form to start  with.
I know it will have to be processed through before it becomes standard.
Thanks,
