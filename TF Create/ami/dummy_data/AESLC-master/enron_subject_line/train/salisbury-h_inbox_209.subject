Good Afternoon,  We have just completed the first part of the application requested this afternoon that will zero-out the schedule strip volumes for deals selected through this new program.
The program I am sending you now only selects deals.
The ability to zero-out the schedules will be available in about an hour.
However, we want to get the program out to you guys as soon as possible so that you can find any potential bugs.
Thanks,  David Poston
