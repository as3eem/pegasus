Our 3/4/02 demand letter only included a Feb02 invoice.
NPC responded that they had already made payment and our investigation proved the same.
Going through the ARRedList I see that we have NPC delinquent on a Jan02 invoice in the amount of $1,694,770.00.
Before I call NPC please make a search of our systems to verify that they have not paid.
Thanks
