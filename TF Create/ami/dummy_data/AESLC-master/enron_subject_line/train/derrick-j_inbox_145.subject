Personal & Confidential  Marc:  Given your message to me the other night, as well as recent communications between your commercial personnel and our credit group, I want to again review the NPW disclosure issues with you, Scott Freeman/Joe Armbrust and Joe Cialone.
I believe that it is essential that we discuss the disclosure issues today, and will be traveling tomorrow.
Please let me know this afternoon when we might be able to talk.
Thanks,
