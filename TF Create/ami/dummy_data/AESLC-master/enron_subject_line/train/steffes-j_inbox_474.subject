This email message revises our previous message in two ways: (1) it corrects the spelling of Dr. Cicchetti's name and (2) it provides a call-in number for the conference room in which the deposition will be held.
We apologize for the misspelling of Dr. Cicchetti's name; unfortunately, we copied the misspelling from the transmittal letter that accompanied Dr. Cicchetti's testimony.
The deposition of Dr. Charles J. Cicchetti will be taken at the offices of Steptoe & Johnson LLP on Wednesday, November 28, 2001, beginning at 9:30 a.m.
