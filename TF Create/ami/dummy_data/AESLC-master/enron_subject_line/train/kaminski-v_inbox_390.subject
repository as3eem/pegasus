Vince,  I am pleased to hear you will be returning to MSCF this year, participating in the Speaker Series on December 7.
Enron has a tremendous reputation in quantitative finance circles and your obvious interest in our students is deeply appreciated.
I know, too, our students are very much looking forward to your visit.
