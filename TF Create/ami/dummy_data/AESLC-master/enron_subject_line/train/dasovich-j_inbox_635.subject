Jeff,  Following is the approximate cost of materials for the deck.
Included in the price is approx.
$1200.00 for 2x6 redwood decking.
materials cost  $ 3190.00  I firgured to use 4x4 redwood posts to support the eventual trellace, as they look better than 'direct burial, DB' pressure treated.
The redwood decking runs $ 1.20/ lin.
ft., which is a good price, if you want me to order this at the same time let me know, I can have it all delivered, as discussed.
Will you be installing the deck as discussed?
