The original 12/2001 recap sent out had an error which effected previous months plus December UAF numbers.
The problem occurred when a station was accidentally removed from the pipeline balance setup within PGAS.
The attached Recap has been corrected to include this meter and 2001 UAF does NOT look good for NNG.
Current NNG UAF: December:	-0.81%		-1,023,077 DTH
