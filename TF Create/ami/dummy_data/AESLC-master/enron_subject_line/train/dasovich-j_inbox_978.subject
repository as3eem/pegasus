I made the plunge and bought a house with Ted in Mill Valley.
It's a cottage nestled in the redwoods overlooking Mt.
Tam.
Stay tuned for the house warming party in January!
Feel free to stop by before!
Below is my new info:  460 Edgewood Ave Mill Valley (415) 383-9588  (write this down because my old number rolls forward to the wrong number).
Hope to see you in January.
(if not before then)    Happy holiday!
