Duke Energy, Environmentalists Strike Deal over California Plant  Tom Knudson   May.
16, 2001  Knight Ridder Tribune Business News - KRTBN  Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World  Reporter (TM)   Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the go-ahead to expand its Moss  Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall, documents show four  environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant.
The four  signed an agreement not to "participate in any lawsuit (or) regulatory  challenge" that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial  concession: $1 million from Duke for environmental "monitoring and research."
Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been  difficult.
But today, as power-starved California scrambles to find and  permit new energy sources, some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that  money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favor
