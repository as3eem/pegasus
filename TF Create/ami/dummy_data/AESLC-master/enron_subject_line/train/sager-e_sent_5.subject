Here is a brief memo prepared by Dan Watkiss relating to the relationship  between TVA transmission and marketing.
N   I will call you later to discuss TVA letter.
Kevin does not want to make  offer to sell at market based rates.
Also want to discuss if there is any  way we can challenge TVA on the hourly tag problems of last week.
Talk to you soon.
Thanks
