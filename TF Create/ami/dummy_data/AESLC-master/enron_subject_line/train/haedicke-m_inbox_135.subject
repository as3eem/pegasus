Attached are drafts of two memos I would like to circulate regarding EBS matters.
One relates to Legal Risk Memos and one relates to legal review of contracts.
I am also preparing one for contract retention.
Would you please let me know if you have any comments?
With respect to risk memos, I understand you announced on Thursday that there are 4 buckets you wanted referenced.
Unfortunately, as you know, I missed Thursday's presentations.
Thanks.
Lance.
