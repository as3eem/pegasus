I am a total procrastinator.
We are leaving for snowy lands this weekend.
and as I have never been to Colorado before, it appears that I do not appreciate how cold it is there.
I am looking to borrow appropriate cold weather clothing, women's size 8 or 10, if anyone is willing.
Please let me know ASAP.
Call me at 713-807-7910.
Thanks,
