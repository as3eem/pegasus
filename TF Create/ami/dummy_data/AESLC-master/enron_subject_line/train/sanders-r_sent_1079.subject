It looks like I will be joining you and Charna in LA on June 6th.
I heard  from Steve, you or Charna( I think) that the meeting was scheduled for  one-half day.
That may be enough time, but if you are coming all the way from  Cleveland, we should make good use of this time.
I think we should schedule  an entire day.
Let me know your schedule.
