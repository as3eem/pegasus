Hello ATW User Group!
OATS WILL BE UNAVAILABLE DECEMBER 29  Below is a message that was sent out by Alex Salpter of the EPA this morning.
The scheduled shut down of the OATS system should be planned on so that you don't find yourself in a last minute attempt to transfer allowances online and not be allowed.
As mentioned below, this especially affects NOx compliance since December 31, 2001 is the last day to transfer allowances in NATS.
Please review and prepare.
Best Regards,
