We are going to try to get to the point of uploading our nomination into pegasys this month so we are changing the meters to correctly reflect what Sitara has vs what PGLC has.
The trade zone TTP is available now and I am going forward and moving November deals into the new trade zone.
I am making a list of all the deals I am changing if anyone needs it.
THESE ARE THE CORRECT METERS TO BE USED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, 2001  PGLC/TTP/TTP - All buys and sales that are not being nominated from a contract - ALL "CHICAGO PEOPLES" EOL DEALS ARE MAPPED TO THIS METER  PGLC/NGPL/NGPL - All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an NGPL Transport  Contract  PGLC/NBPL/NBPL01 - All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an NBPL Transport Contract  PGLC/ANR/ANR -All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an ANR Transport Contract
