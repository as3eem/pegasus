Dan,  Please be advised that the steamleakage on port boiler is now repaired.
The boiler will be pressure tested and closed at 1400lt today, 24th, and expected to be in service around 2200.
The leakage was caused by a loose bar, which has hammered on one of the tubes in the waterwall by vibration.
The vessel's eta Lake Charles will still be June 8th 0100.
Best regards
