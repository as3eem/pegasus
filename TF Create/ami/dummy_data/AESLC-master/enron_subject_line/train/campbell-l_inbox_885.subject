DCongel@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Market Participants:  In a billing inquiry sent to us concerning the June 2000 adjustments made per the email below, which was sent on 7/10/2000, we noticed an incorrect value was stated for the NYISO clearing account balance prior to adjustment.
That value was $7,831,072.52.
The value should have been $7,262,238.10, and this has caused problems for reconciling your invoices.
