When I think of how you must feel, it's hard for me to even breath, it must hurt so bad...and I know you must be so very, very sad.
But the greatest thing about the doggies...is that they give everlasting, unconditional love!
Wish I could give you a great big hug too, but I'm sure Mr. Bean and Greta will drown you in love when you get home to them tonight!
What happened, was it some silly little fight or some really big issue?
