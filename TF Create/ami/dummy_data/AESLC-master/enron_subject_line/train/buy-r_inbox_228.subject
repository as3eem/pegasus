Rick,      As discussed earlier, most of the Research group does not want to come along.
Given that, here are some names of people who are capable, and who may be more willing to stay on board.
I have put folks with a valuation focus, who could help out on deal revaluations, etc.
Naveen  Members for Estate  Alex Huang (valuation)  Jaesoo Lew  (risk for estate) Paolo Issler (valuation) Robert Lee (valuation) Nelson Neale Tom Barkley (valuation)  Currently Laid-off  Stig Faltinsen (UK) Kirstee Hewitt (UK)
