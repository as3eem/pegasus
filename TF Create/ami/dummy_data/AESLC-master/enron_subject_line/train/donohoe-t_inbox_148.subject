Scott,   Could you please move the following deals from Tom Donohoe's desk to the Upstream desk for June forward and enter corresponding desk to desk tickets?
However, on the gas daily desk to desk, can we please aggregate all the volumes and enter just one desk to desk at the ANR pool?
If you have any questions regarding this please feel free to ask either myself, George or Charlie.
It would be great, if you could get this done before tomorrow.
