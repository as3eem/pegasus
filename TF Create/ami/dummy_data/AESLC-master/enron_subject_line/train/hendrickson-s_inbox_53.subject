Hello Scooter,  Hope you had fun on your three dates this weekend!!!
(you slut!)
You know I am jealous.
Peggy says not to spread yourself too thin!!!!
You would not believe how cheap it is here.
Today at the musuem I had a sandwich, snickers and a cafe latte for $1.50!!!
A three course dinner last night cost $3.00.
The bad news is that your gift cost $0.20!!
(ha, ha)  I really haven't bought it yet.
Take Care,  Miss you,  Julie  :-)
