Janette  Mark had asked me to call Williams and invite them to the ISDA Energy meeting  in Houston last week.
Tim at Williams very much wanted to participate.
As  you can see from his email, he must not be on the distribution list for  ISDA.
Can you see if it is OK to add him to the distribution list for future  meetings.
Also, I called Dynegy at Mark's request and they very much want to  participate as well - Harlan Murphy called me afterwards to ask that he also  get notice of the meetings because they fully support the idea of one Master  for all trades.
I will get Genia to forward Harlan's address info to you.
Thanks for your help.
