Hey y'all!
Just wanted to send out a little email letting you know how to get a hold of me in the next few months....I am driving out of Boulder tomorrow and heading to Dallas to be with Karin and my little guy....I can no longer be reached at my home number or at work....The best way to reach me in the next month will be my cell phone (720)-980-8011....I am driving back to Boulder in late August to fly out to Europe with Mike for about 10 weeks....At that point I will cancel my cell phone and the only way I can be reached is by email....I am going to give out my sisters number since that is where I will be staying mostly but please remember that there is now a baby in the house....(972)-423-6618...I hope that I keep in touch with all of you, I miss you terribly and will try to email as often as I can from overseas.....I hope this email finds all of you healthy and happy!
Love,
