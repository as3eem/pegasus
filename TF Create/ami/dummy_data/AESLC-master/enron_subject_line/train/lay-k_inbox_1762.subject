A request for 2002 contribution was mailed from the NCPA in error this week.
We realize Enron is going through a tough time, and wanted to apoligize for sending a request for money at this time.
John and I wish you our best, and know your strength will overcome this challenge.
We appreciate your efforts on our behalf, and look forward to seeing you in the future.
