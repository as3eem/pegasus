Hi Team.
I just want to make sure everyone gets this message.
Effective  September 1, we will be using "The New Power Company" in sitara.
All  existing deals will need to be changed to "The New Power Company" in sitara.
If you enter deals in the sitara or you find an existing deal with the  counterparty "Columbia Energy Services", please change the counterparty to  "The New Power Company".
Thanks
