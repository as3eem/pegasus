Dear Carolyn:  Would you please be so kind as to see what information we have in our files regarding Enron Gas Processing and HPL, each of whom owned a plant and gathering system, respectively, which were sold to Encinal and Cerritos.
Do we have a copy of the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated 2/10/95?
I'm looking for this on behalf of Ann Elizabeth White, who went to AEP with HPL.
Please advise, and thanks, Mary
