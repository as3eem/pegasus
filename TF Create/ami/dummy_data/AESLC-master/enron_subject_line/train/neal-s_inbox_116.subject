I think most of you know that we gave Jeff a gift certificate for Forno's, which came with a free night of babysitting, by me.
We also gave trophies to the assistant coaches.
I know some of you have reimbursed me.
If you have not and would like to do so, (naturally, it is purely voluntary), please send $10 to:  Beth Hurst 502 Regentview Dr. Houston, TX   77079-6909  Thanks, Beth
