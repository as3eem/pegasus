Sandi:  Apologies.
I meant and forgot to mention on the 11:30 call that the pipeline  group is having their annual customer meeting (VPs of large energy companies  throughout the West and Midwest) at the Santa Barbara Biltmore on April 12th  and 13th.
They would very much like to get Bill Keese to speak (preferably on the  morning of the 13th, but the morning of the 12th would work as well).
They'd  like Bill to discuss the energy situation in California.
They can cover  however much of Bill's costs--if any--that the State of California allows to
