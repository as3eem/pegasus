We are in the process of determining which demand letter recipients will receive termination letters today.
Several CPs have outstanding issues which we are investigating (largely claims that the amounts due have already been paid).
Based on current information, we will send termination notice to the following CPs.
Their MTM value is included, as this amount will shift from "live" to "terminated."
Counterparty			$MTM (millions)
