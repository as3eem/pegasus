Tracy,  Have you had a chance to evaluate your resource needs for the month of October.
Currently, I am showing both Riaz and Hoang reserved for ETS the first three  weeks of October.
I am anticipating we will need to focus on the following items in October:  Upgrade to Contributor V 2.2 Completion of home office model Completion of administration and consolidation items Final migration to production Northern Border Balance Sheet/Cash Flow   I also wanted to know if you can possibly spare Hoang for two days the week of 10/8.
Please advise.
Thanks.
