Sevil,   As I stated to you yesterday, I am extremely sorry for causing so much confusion over the non-existent compensation concern.
I would like to reassure you though that there are no problems or concerns, and that I was just letting my mind get ahead of me, and was mixing different thought processes and projects.
Unfortunately, you had to reap the repercussions of my brain malfunction.
I hope that you accept my apology, and can rest with an easy mind.
Anne
