Good morning!
You must be having another excitement-filled day?
Sorry  about the parking tickets...found them this morning on the floor of my car.
Maybe they were stuck to my clothes?
I just want you to know I'm ready to  come back as soon as the agency gets their shit together.
Come on  Enron...KEEP ON KEEPING ON!!!!!!
Have a good day.
