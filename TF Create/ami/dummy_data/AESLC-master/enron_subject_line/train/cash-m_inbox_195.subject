Michelle,  I hope you had a good Christmas.
I would appreciate if you could please let me know where you stand with the agreement to release both me and Enron from the obligations contained in my employment contract.
I have a firm offer for employment that is running out of time.
I would greatly appreciate your help in resolving this issue as soon as possible.
I look forward to receiving a draft of the agreement by email as per our understanding.
Thank you for your attention.
Regards,
