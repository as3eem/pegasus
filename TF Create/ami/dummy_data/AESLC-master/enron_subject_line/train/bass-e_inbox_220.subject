"I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord."
Luke 2:10, 11  Dear Americans,  As we prepare to celebrate the birthday of Jesus Christ, let me take this opportunity to wish you a joyous Christmas celebration and peace in the New Year.
May the true meaning of Christmas, God's gift of His own son as our savior, be yours in this holiday season and throughout the New Year.
May God continue to bless our nation and its leaders, especially President George Bush, as we confront an enemy who hates everything this nation stands for -- peace,
