we are scheduling execution of NNG 1st wave and some TW 2nd wave mortgages on sunday afternoon starting at 1:00.  planes are scheduled to depart 6:00 am monday morning.
i know we have some questions on the minnesota and kansas tax issues.
these questons would have to be resolved before the mortgages are executed.
signing should take at least 2 hours - 300 instruments to sign.
i can move the signing ceremony til later in the day if that helps...i'll be executing for NNG.
Jen - i would like you there and a notary from your shop.
thx
