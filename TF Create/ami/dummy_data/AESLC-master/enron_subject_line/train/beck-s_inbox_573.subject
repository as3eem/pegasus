Everyone:  Thanks for the data you have sent.
The initial analysis phase has been completed.
Towards reaching our ultimate objective we request October 2001 (actual) net A/R data rolled up to the corporate parent and November 2001 (estimated) net A/R data rolled up to the corporate parent.
Please send your files to me by noon Thursday, November 1.
On Thursday afternoon, Tim Proffitt and I would like to schedule meetings with someone from each group to review the data and confirm our understanding of the receivables cycle.
If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please call me as soon as possible.
Thank you for your help.
