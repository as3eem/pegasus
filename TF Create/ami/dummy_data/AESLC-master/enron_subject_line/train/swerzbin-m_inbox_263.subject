Mike -  Both the options and the restricted stock vest 33.33% 1st, 2nd, and 3rd anniversary from grant date with a 5 year term.
Also, I have requested the change to your agreement on the retention payments.
Tim asked me to change the payment dates to the following:  4/1/02 4/1/03 4/1/04  He did not want to add any more to the signing payment per a conversation that he had with Lavo.
I hope this works for you.
Let me know if you need any more information!
Amy
