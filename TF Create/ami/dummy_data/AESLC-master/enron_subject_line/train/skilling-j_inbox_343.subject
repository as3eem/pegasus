Jeff, Thanks for being on the panel at the CEO Forum.
I really appreciated getting to hear the Enron story and talk through the talent issues with you.
At my end, I am targeting my time to work with a few executive teams who are looking to forge a consensus response to problematic issues around managing for shareholder value, dealing with the "nasty bit," and managing context so that it does not overtake core.
If I could ever be of use to you at Enron, it would be a privilege.
Cheers,
