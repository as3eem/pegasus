Ken and Tori: I am very pleased that you are willing to try to arrange for yourself, Ken, or someone come to guest lecture in the course Don Tapscott and I are teaching.
Per your email of sept 21, I know that Nov 16 doesn't work.
I responded on sept 23 that the two other days that would fit in the course schedule are Oct 12 and Nov 2.
If I could now ask you a big favor and that is that I need to nail down an Enron date so that I can juggle the other speakers accordingly.
So if at all possible, I would dearly love to hear by the end of this week.
Thanks so much for helping.
R.
