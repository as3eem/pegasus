Sara,  I'm attaching a draft of the futures agreement to "get the ball rolling" again.
I believe I have included the terms you indicated were most important.
One item I would like to bring to your attention is the arbitration clause.
Morgan Stanley prefers to litigate disputes, but I can agree to NFA arbitration rather than litigation.
I know New York is our preferred location, and Texas is yours, so I thought that holding the arbitration in Chicago might equally inconvenience us.
Please let me know if this works for you.
Regards,
