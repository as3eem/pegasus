Dianne,  Thanks for all your work for the Travel Club.
I never make a meeting, but  really enjoy the tickets, etc.
One question I have is whether Enron has any special relationships with  Disney.
Are we a corporate client of Disney?
My old law firm had some sort  of relationship with Disney that let us get great deals, early entry into the  parks, etc., so it may be worth looking into.
Thanks again.
