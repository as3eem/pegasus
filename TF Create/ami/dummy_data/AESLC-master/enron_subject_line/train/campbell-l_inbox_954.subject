Larry:   HE 13 EDT - Original deal made for 50 MW @ $82.20 - Hourly P&L notes deal was cut at 12:15 and therefore only 13 MW flowed as confirmed by PJM data - Tag review indicates flow started at 12:15 and ended at HE 13  (38 MW flow) - Settlements is requesting this be revised back to 50MW @ $60/MW - I need input from you regarding this deal to determine the action required.
Please provide any helpful info you have as soon as possible.
HE 10 EDT - Just an FYI that the purchase price was changed to $41/MW from $42 at the request of Exelon to our Settlements group.
I went ahead and changed it due to the low value and because it is in our favor.
If you disagree with this or have any questions, please let me know.
Thanks,
