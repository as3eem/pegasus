Thank you for attending to the talk last Friday.
The current version of the program can be installed by double click on file setup.exe in O:\Research\Common\from_cs\fullReqDispatch\installation directory.
It has a security checking system that allows only Enron people with readable-access to O:\Research directory to be able to run the program.
If you have any questions or problems please let me know.
Thank you,
