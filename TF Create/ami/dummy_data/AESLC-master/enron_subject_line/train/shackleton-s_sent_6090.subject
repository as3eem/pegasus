Anna:  I would like to fax the resume of Kristina Fisher to you (I do not have a  word version to email).
She is the candidate about whom we spoke recently.
I have also asked Kristina to visit the website "www.enroncareers.com" and  apply through that process.
I assume that you are the person who receives  inquiries on the website.
Please advise me of your fax number and I can send the resume directly to you.
Thanks so much for your interest.
