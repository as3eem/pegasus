Hello Lizzette and Michelle, Attached are the revised EEO and Harassment Prevention policies, and links for all policies.
Lizzette, I noted that you placed a question mark next to the "Unlawful (under FMLA)" link.
It is my understanding that the FMLA policy narrative and the related links are going to be revised/updated by Kriste Sullivan and Chris Rahaim.
In our last Project N-Form meeting, we agreed that Kriste and Chris would communicate their changes to Anne Labbe and Sarah Zarkowsky (members of the Content team).
Please let me know if you have additional changes.
Thanks again for your assistance!
Wendy
