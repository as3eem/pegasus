Please review the attached "paper & pulp" doc for accuracy.
I've already  marked the doc for accuracy (as far as I can tell) but I don't know if the  general statements are accurate.
Please coordinate through Tana Jones.
I do  not know who wrote the document, but I presume it was someone in London.
