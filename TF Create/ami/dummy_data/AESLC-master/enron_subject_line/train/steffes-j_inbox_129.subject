Kim, I have done an exhaustive audit of what needs to be paid in order to bring our DA bills current in PGE and SCE.
All the bills included on these files are pre-petition.
We are not past due on any post-petition  bills.
I will be out until January 2 (unless Evan can come up with a compelling reason for me to come back sooner) so I am saving the files on the P drive in a folder called "Diann" in case a payment needs to be made this week.
I will be in town, so please don't hesitate to page me if you have questions.
(The two files with CPUC on the end are the files which go to Jean Bennett with Goodin, et al.)
In summary, we need to pay $14,313,872.35 to bring us current:  SCE Disputed bills = $1,349,729.51 to be wired to Goodin, et al SCE Undisputed bills = $276,090.13 to be paid to UDC  PGE Disputed = $11,713,991.02 to be wired to Goodin, et al PGE Undisputed = $974,061.69 to be paid to UDC
