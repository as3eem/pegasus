Spoke with Jeff Gollomp who is trying to obtain internal approval for financial trading with one of the operating utilities (as opposed to using the agent).
He anticipates a corporate restructuring which may delay matters.
He understands our allocation concerns.
He inquired about AEP as a comparable type of counterparty but we did not attempt to discuss (and were not at liberty to discuss).
Jeff asked that I wait to hear from him.
By copy of this entry, I am advising Ed Sacks of the status.
