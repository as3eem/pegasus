The attached schedules have been generated with adjustment factors to reflect apparent over-estimation of customer loads, based on an analysis of EES meter data by Tim Coffing and on comparisons of past metered loads to previous  forecasts produced.
The impact of the adjustments lowers load totals by averages of approximately 100 mW in the NP15 zone and another 50-60 mW in the SP15 zone.
These adjustments, which will continue to be refined with further analysis, have been discussed with Tim.
Please call if you have any questions regarding these changes.
