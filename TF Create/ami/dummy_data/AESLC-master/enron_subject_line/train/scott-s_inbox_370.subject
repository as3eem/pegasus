All,  Attached is a spreadsheet of Enron's curve names for the West book.
We just need a quick status on the broker quotes you have and the ones still needed/missing.
Please review the curves against the broker data you have (including electronic files), and indicate any gaps.
Based on your reply, the Estate will purchase the missing data.
Please have this prepared by 12:00 tomorrow.
