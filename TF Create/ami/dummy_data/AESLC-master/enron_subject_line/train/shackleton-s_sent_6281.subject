Lisa:  FYI, there has been activity regarding the KCS file, in particular, the  status of the amendment to permit cross-netting of certain agreements and the  impact of that amendment now that KCS has emerged from bankruptcy.
Two (2)  new financial transactions have been executed and there is a VPP looming  ahead for June 15.
The issue which we were trying to isolate is the effect  of the amendment to the financial/physical agreements post-bankruptcy.
We  concluded that KCS is bound post-bankruptcy (Carol St. Clair thought you may  have had some reservations).
I'll keep you apprised of any developments.
