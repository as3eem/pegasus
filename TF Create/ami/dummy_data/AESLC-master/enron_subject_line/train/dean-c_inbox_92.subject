Hey, just wanted to let you know that Melissa was induced this morning and baby Lauren should be here sometime later this afternoon.
I'm not sure if you are on her email list but I will forward any pictures I get on to you.
Hope you had a good weekend, sounds like you're definitely living the high life with all the single girls!
How fun!
:) I, on the other hand, am picking out baby furniture & decorations....crazy isn't it?
Well, take care and I'll talk with you soon.

Melissa's baby!
