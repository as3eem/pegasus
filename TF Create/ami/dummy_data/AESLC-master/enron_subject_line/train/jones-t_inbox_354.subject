FYI -   I just did a full contract assignment.
Both of these counterparties were in EOL.
I updated EOL by removing the contract number from Merchant Energy and putting that contract number on TransAlta.
(I did notice on TransAlta Energy that there was a contract number 95001154 in some of the financial categories.
95001154 is not a financial contract and it should not have been in any of the financial categories.)
New CP:  TransAlta Energy Marketing (U.S.) Inc. (cp #62413) (k #96019306)   Old CP:  Merchant Energy Group of the Americas, Inc. (cp #59152) (k #96019306)     Let me know if you have any questions.
