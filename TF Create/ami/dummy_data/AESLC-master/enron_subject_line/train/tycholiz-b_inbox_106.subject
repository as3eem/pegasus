Barry, et al:  FYI.
Some initial info I got from our outside council regarding utility authority to engage in financial risk management tools.
More info to follow as we get it.
If you have quesitons, comments, or suggestions for additional research needed, just holler.
Please forward to others who might need it.
Best,
