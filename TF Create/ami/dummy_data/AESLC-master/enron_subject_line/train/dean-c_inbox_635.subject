FYI -  We'll need to pay APS back for transmission line losses incurred on 9/17.
Please send them 3 mw during one heavy load hour tomorrow - losses were incurred HE 8, but may be paid back at anytime on-peak.
They need the energy delivered at either PV or 4C.
Make purchase and sale under STWHOURLY, and please tag this payback as well.
Let me know the relevant deal & tag numbers, and I will convey these to APS.
Thanks.
