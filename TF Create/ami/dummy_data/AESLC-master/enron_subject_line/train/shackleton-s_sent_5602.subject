Tanya:  We finally agreed on the guaranty form (the cap is $25 million) and are about  ready to execute the actual agreement.
I have one question:  in the ISDA  world, we use "cost of funds plus 1%" as the default interest rate.
The Bear  document provides:  "...interest thereon at a rate equal to (A) in the case of purchases of  Foreign Securities, LIBOR, (B) in the case of purchases of any other  securities (or other amounts, if any, due to Lender hereunder), the Federal  Funds Rate or (C) such other rate as may be specified in Schedule B, in each  case as such rate fluctuates from day to day, from the date of such purchase  until the date of payment of such excess."
What is your preference:  Bear's standard language or do you want to specify  another rate?
