Due to current circumstances, until further notice all curves need to be marked by 12:30 pm and the Risk Management group will begin all calculations by 1:15 pm Pacific time.
We will try to work with all of you the best we can, but please understand that it will be on a case by case basis.
We have been asked to ensure that we meet these deadlines as often as possible.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding these times please let me know.
John
