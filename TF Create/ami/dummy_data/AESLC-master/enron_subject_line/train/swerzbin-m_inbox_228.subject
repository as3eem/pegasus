MWHRs =  4 Years and 1 quarter Flat so that equals approximately 37,250 Hours  The difference between 102 (the new amount) and 94.5 (the old average flat amount) = 7.5 MW * 37,250 HRs = 279,375 MWhrs  I was under the impression that a 100 MW flat amount would equal $3 million value (a $16 difference between market and $21.50).
This would indicate the 102 equals a $4,100,000 valuation.
As to the discount in value due to the flexibility and delivery point I am looking to you for leadership.
If my assumptions are wrong then let me know.
