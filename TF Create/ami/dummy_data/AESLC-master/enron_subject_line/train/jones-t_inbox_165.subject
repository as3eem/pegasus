Dear Tana, If you're like many Americans, your thoughts have been with friends  and family more than ever in the past few weeks.
Wouldn't it be nice  to spend Thanksgiving with the people you love?
Many airlines have  slashed rates to encourage travelers to do just that.
Great deals are  available on car rentals, too.
Vacation packages, hotel rates, even  cruises are now being offered at unusually low rates.
We invite you  to visit Travelocity to start planning your Thanksgiving getaway!
