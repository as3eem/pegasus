Marie - per our conversation yesterday afternoon, attached are proposed drafts of the Schedule and the Para.
13 relative to the above.
Having spoken with Dennis Goldmann, I am advised that there are currently 2 Guaranties in place in the sum of $8M each:  one by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc f/b/o Enron, and one by Enron Inc. f/b/o Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing.
I am told that our respective credit departments want to raise the credit lines to $10M for each party, but to effect that we will have to modify the existing Guaranties accordingly.
Let me know if this is your understanding, as well.
After you have had the chance to review the attached, please send me a marked-up draft and we can discuss our concerns from there.
