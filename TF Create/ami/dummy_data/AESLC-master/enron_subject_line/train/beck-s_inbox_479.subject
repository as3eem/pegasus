Here is the report we've put together summarizing headcount by function and business unit.
There are some changes from the figures Fin Ops had last week, mainly relating to EES (both 2001 forecast and 2002 Plan were off).
Brian will coordinate with Fin Ops to ensure they reflect the same figures that we now show.
There are two things that will be updated once we receive more information: 1)  EES 2002 headcount will be increasing (Shelly Butler to provide as soon as they have it) 2)  EBS forecast and plan headcount will be broken out by function - right now, we just have one number.
Call me if you have any questions.
Thanks,
