John,  I met with Con-Ed last week.
They asked if Market Link @ Leidy was going to be good liquid point to buy long term supply.
I told them that I didn't think so but would do a little research for them.
I know you worked pretty hard on this one.
Do you have an overview/summary that  I could look at including some rough economics.
