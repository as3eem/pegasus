Dad, I was talking with Kathleen this weekend and she had some ideas and suggestions about Enron.
I asked her to put them in writing so that I could share them with you.
I am attaching her memo.
Please keep in mind, she loves her job, these are just ideas to make it that much better.
I love you, Dad,
