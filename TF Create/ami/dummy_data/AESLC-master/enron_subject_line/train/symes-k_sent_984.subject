These deals were entered today under STWH desk - Geir and Mark show as the  traders on them, but I have a feeling that's incorrect as I haven't seem them  around this morning.
Might let the guys know that when they trade at  California delivery points - NP15, SP15, ZP26 - the energy firmness should be  specified as CAISO firm.
Thanks,
