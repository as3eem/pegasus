To the trading lawyers working on counterparty lists:  Per the email below from Louise, the current target date for completion of  counterparty lists appears to be Tuesday, October 12.
As noted below, an  additional list of approved counterparties should be provided to us tomorrow.
FYI, per my conversations w/Frank Davis, the first simulation occurred this  week, and an additional simulation is scheduled for next week.
