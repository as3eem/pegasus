Hi Scott,  I just wanted to let you know that have been in Houston for a while since the office in Bogota closed down at the end of last year.
I am currently working in the DSM Desk in EES and I would definitely like to speak to you whenever you have some time.
Please let me know when would be a good time for you.
Best regards,
