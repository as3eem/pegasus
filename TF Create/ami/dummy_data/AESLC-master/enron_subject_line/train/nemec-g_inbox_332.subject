Attached is the tpa file , apparently the Standard GISB tpa was "modified' by our legal department and this is what my group has been using ever since.
I  was given this file when I started here in January of this year.
Please verify that the information is accurate since the original template must have  generated from      legal and passed on to Gary Payne.
I am assuming that Kim Bennick had a template somewhere.
Thanks       Shane
