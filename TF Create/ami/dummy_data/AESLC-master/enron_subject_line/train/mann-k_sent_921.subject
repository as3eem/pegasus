I working with outside counsel to get a draft of the revolver prepared.
She  (outside counsel, Heather Brown) has summarized the information I have given  her as follows (see below), and I would appreciate your input as to whether  it is accurate.
Once we get a draft we can sit down and discuss it, and make sure we are on  the right track.
I believe Gregg said that this needs to be in place within 2  weeks.
Thanks,
