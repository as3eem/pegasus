On September 20, 2001, NEPOOL submitted proposed amendments to its July 6, 2001 Market Rule Filing which proposed to limit ISO-NE's ability to recall the Energy associated with exports of Installed Capability ("ICAP").
Filed at the request of the Commission, NEPOOL's amendment informs the Commission on the general impact of the ISO-NE ICAP Order on the NEPOOL Filing.
Generally, NEPOOL informs the Commission that its recent ICAP Order has little impact on NEPOOL's request, and NEPOOL has sought a November 1, 2001 effective date for the ICAP recall Rules.
Please let me know if you need further information.
