Mr. Nemec -  This email is a follow-up to my voice message to you last week regarding the above-referenced document.
I work with Bill Mathews in the Denver office and we are preparing a compression administration agreement between Bear Paw Energy and Independent Production.
We are working off of your agreement and I was wondering if you could email me (tricia.flanigan@enron.com) the above-referenced agreement.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 720-946-3661.
Thank you,
