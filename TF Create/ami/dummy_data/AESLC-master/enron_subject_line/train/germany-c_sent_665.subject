The deal number for the gas below is $4.44.
We are using ENA transport and  the deliveries are on a secondary basis.
The deal number is 322199 and I  added the meter numbers that I used to enter the deals.
Robert, Joann, the  volumes should not change and CES would like to keep this deal seperate from  all other deals.
Please let me know if there are any questions.
