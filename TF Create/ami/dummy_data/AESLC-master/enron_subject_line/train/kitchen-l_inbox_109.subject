Just talked to Leslie Reeves about the meeting today.
Did I miss something?
Did we ever talk about a presentation around readiness for a January 20th implimetation?
Maybe I missed something or it went to the other Bob Hall.
After the holidays, I would like to get in your calendar and  discuss how Operations gets included more upfront.
thanks
