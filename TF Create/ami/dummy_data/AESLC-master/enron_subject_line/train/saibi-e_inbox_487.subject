All,    There has been some maintenance on LIM (XMIM, MIM etc.).
So, if you are using excel addin please follow the below instructions.
1.
Reboot the (your) machine  2.
Run Start -> Programs -> Business applications -> LIM -> Xmim Excel User (installation)   After these steps you should be able to use the lim, mim etc.
This should work.
