Hey Gerald,  I just wanted to update you on what I have been up to.
I have been working on a couple of small assignments for various lawyers and paralegals.
Steve Van Hooser brought me in on a big project that he is trying to wrap up.
The documents are to be executed tomorrow.
Despite the work that I have been given, I don't feel that I have much to work on.
I have been stopping in offices asking for work, but nobody wants me to work.
Any suggestions?
Alisha
