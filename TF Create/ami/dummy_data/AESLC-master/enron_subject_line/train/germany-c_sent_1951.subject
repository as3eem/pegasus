I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me.
If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities  are the same now.
In Jan, the "true backhaul" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was  $.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges.
We actually did  some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.
I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until  October, after the summer period?
