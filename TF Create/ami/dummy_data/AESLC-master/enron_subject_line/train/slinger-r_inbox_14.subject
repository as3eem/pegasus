Hey thanks for coming out to see the boys the other night, if you weren't there you missed a good show.
24BOM will probably play with Junco Parker again.
But more important than that is Thursday night at the Medicine Hat Gallery- 18th and Alberta St-  9:00 PM.
Show up and give some support, 24BOM will be recording live that night and it would be great to have some crowd response on that cd!!
Thanks again for your support- hope to see you there
