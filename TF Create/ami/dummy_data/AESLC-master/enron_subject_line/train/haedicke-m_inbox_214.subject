Mark,  Long time no see - I hope you're doing well despite the difficult times we're in.
Enron Europe Limited entered into administration earlier today, but nobody seems to have much idea or can render any information about the faith of the captioned company and its Nordic power trading business.
We are thus pretty much in the dark over here and I wonder if you can you advise us or direct us to somebody that can.
Thanks.
Martin
