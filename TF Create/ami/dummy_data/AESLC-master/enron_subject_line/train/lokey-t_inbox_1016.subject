On January 29, 2002, Enron named Stephen F. Cooper interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.
To keep employees informed about developments, Mr. Cooper left voicemail messages to employees on January 29 and February 8.
Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcripts of those messages.
