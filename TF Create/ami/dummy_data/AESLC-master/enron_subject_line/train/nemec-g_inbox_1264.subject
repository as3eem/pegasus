Gerald,  Have you had time to work on developing the GTC Firm Point based confirmation for the deals that are bought at a point but are not Committed Reserves (i.e.
Month-long wellhead deals)?
The Global Contracts group would like to get a copy of even a rough form so that they can make sure that the Global contracts template is set up and functioning before bid week is upon us again.
Thanks,
