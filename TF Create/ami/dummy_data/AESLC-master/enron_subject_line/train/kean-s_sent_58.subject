I agree with Rick.
I know Jose is tied up on current business, but his input  will be important.
To date we have been relying on legal analysis of  required approvals etc.
That information is essential but it is, as you  know, about 10% of the issue.
The far more critical considerations are how  is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do  about it.
I think our government affairs people are in the best position to  make these assessments.
