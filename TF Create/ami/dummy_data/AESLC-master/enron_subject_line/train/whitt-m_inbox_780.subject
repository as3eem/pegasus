<<Enron Blew It - 11-01.doc>>   I just opened my Texas Monthly, only to find more Enron news.
Did you see it?
The article entitled  "HOW ENRON BLEW IT" Enron's Cutthroat Culture (on the cover) Texas Monthly, November 2001 By Mimi Swartz  For Houston's sake as the Energy Capital, we hope the best for Enron as it turns this thing around.
Attached is the article and below is the link and an excerpt.
If you have any comments on the article, we always like to hear them.
Best, Mark
