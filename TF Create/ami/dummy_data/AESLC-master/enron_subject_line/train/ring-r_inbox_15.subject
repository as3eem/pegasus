Richard:   I understand from Elliot that we want to keep the spreadsheet of EES positions separate from our Fundies site.
I started a file at O:\Portland\WestDesk\RenewablePowerDesk\Shared\Internal intelligence\EES Position based on the info.
you provided to Jesse in an e-mail dated 10/8.
The spreadsheet is attached.
*Will this spreadsheet meet our needs?
*Is the location suitable?
