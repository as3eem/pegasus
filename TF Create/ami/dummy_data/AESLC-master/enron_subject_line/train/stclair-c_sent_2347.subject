Mark, Sara and Mary: Jim would like to talk to someone about problems he is having with his  customers concerning the ISDA and CSA forms.
Apparently, most of his  customers feel that it is too complicated and Jim would like to see if any  alternatives exist.
Could someone please contact him?
Thanks.
