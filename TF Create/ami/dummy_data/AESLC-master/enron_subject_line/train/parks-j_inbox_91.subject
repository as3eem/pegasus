Over the weekend CPR and TAGG were moved to a different set of databases.
Because of this move, you will now have different menu options.
There are two ways to access these new menu options:   1) Log off and log back in  2) You can go to Start|Programs|System Utility Applications|Update Start Menu   The new menu options contain 'BL'.
(i.e.
CPR BL Apps and TAGG - BL)   If you experience any problems, please call the appropriate pager number and we will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
