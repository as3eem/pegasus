Documentum just called back.
They said they manually reviewed everything that has not yet been scanned into the system and cannot find any Agreements or Amendments for New Power Company.
I have checked with Karen Cordova since her initials are on the document to see if possibly she had any extra documents, and she does not.
I doubt we will be able to get an executed copy of this Amendment.
