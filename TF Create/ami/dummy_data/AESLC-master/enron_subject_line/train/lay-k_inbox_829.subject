Ken,  I'm an ex-Enron employee who was with Houston Pipe Line & later with Enron Gas Services & I want you to know I do not hold you responsible for the situation we are all currently in.
There is no one else I would rather have trying to make this a successful company again than yourself.
I have seen you in action ever since the merger & I know you can do it.
I have attached a copy of a letter that I have sent to certain members of Congress.
Charge on & Best of luck  Jim Jurek  - Congressional Letter re Enron.doc
