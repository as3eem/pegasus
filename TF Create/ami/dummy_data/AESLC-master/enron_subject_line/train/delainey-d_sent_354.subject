Dick, you need to agree with Max on the scope to be provided by the OE - I  expect high quality service for the money we are paying.
The deal on Friday  is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of  service.
I expect high quality EE&CC  people to be proactively managing cost  and exposure and to be there for the whole process - no pulls to other  business lines.
If Max or Virgo are not happy I am not happy.
I make money you make money.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Regards
