I believe that there is a general consensus that Clem needs assistance to  respond timely to  the mounting number of guaranties requested from Enron  Corp.
In speaking with Clem, it seems that any evidence of increased and  increasing business and demand for guaranties will be helpful for him to  obtain help.
Would your group be able to put together some facts and  projections which might address the continuing demand for new guaranties?
Since you are the first (and most important) point of contact for evaluating  potential business, I think that your input would be extremely valuable for  Clem to "plead his case."
