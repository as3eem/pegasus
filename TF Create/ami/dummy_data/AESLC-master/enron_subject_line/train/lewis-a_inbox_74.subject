Hey Andy-   Long time since we last spoke.
I hope all is  well with you.
I assume you are still happily living in Texas.
I'm  still living in Colorado, and I met a nice girl named Paula, and we're getting  married.
Paula and I wanted to send you an invitation to our wedding in  August.
Can you send us your address so we can mail you an  invitation?
