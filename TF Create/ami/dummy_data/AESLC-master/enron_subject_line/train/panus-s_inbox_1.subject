Hello, Stephanie,  I must first apologise for the delay in replying to your email/attachments fo 24 July.
Our reply is for the ISDA with Vitol Capital Management, but I hope that once we have agreed the wording for this , we will be able to quickly implement ISDA's for the other Vitol and Enron entities involved ...
I expect that we will just have to change the tax declarations, the address details and a few other similar minor items.
Attached is a covering letter and revised draft schedule.

Thanks and regards, David
