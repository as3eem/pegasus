Hi there,  In resolving some issues with Westinghouse there was an agreement reached  concerning the disposition of the Blue Girl turbines, as well as certain  issues relating to the Gleason and Wheatland facilities.
In connection with  this agreement I am forwarding to you a draft letter agreement concerning  resolution of these matters.
As you can see, Westinghouse has requested that  NEPCO, EEPC and LJM2-Turbine, LLC sign the agreement.
Your comments would be appreciated.
Kay
