He also indicated that the Minimum Annual Fee is really monthly--thus under the No Term scenario, with a 60-day cancellation:  if we were to terminate & begin using our own QSE prior to the 60 day cancellation we'd only be liable for the $20K in "Liquidated Damages"...$10K monthly minimum * 2 months.
The point is, if we only use 2 months we're not liable for $100K for unused months because of the "MINIMUM ANNUAL FEE OF $120K."
