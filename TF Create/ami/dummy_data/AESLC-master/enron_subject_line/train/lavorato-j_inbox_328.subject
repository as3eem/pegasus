Dear John,  Dina's returns are leaving our offices today by courier so you should have them tomorrow.
The only year for which there is an amount owing is 1998 - including interest and penalties, the total is $34 US.
Please contact Laurie Pare (403) 509-7569 or myself if you have any questions or concerns.
Best regards,
