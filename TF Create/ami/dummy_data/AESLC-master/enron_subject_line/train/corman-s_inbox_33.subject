Dannis,  Per your instruction, I have issued an Operational Flow Order to Reliant Energy for gas day of Oct 19th.
Germaine Grey and Bob Rossi of Reliant Energy have been contacted via phone & fax.
I have also prepared the OFO form, the cover letter that contains the OFO tariff language, as well as the fax cover sheet  for gas days of October 20th & 21st in the event there is a need to issue an order.
If by chance these orders are not issued, please let me know Monday, October 22nd so that I can remove the orders from the TSS system.
I will leave this OFO information on your desk in the event you have questions or changes.
Please pass along to Gas Control.
Thanks,
