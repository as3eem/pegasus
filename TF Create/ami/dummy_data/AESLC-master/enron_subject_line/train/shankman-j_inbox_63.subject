Per your request this AM find attached break-even economics for gulf coast refiners with cracking and alkylation but no hydrocracking and coking.
This represents approx 30 pct of the gulf coast refining capacity.
The light/heavy spread mentioned is the spread between residual fuel oil and light products.
The info comes from McKinsey.
