Rick  One question we are often asked is how do security and risk relate?
Risk is the potential reduction in asset values from threats and vulnerabilities.
Security is an ability you possess to protect specific assets in specific way(s).
So the answer is:  Security is able to reduce risk in specific areas but without the full breadth of risk defined it is impossible to determine how significant security solutions are.
