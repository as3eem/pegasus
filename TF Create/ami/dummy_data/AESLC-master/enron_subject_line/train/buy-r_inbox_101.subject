You are in the New York Times today, page C6.
Can't tell if it's good or bad cuz I don't understand business jargon.
I'm about to go for a little run.
It's beautiful out.
Met a new professor today, Russian but nice.
Ready for summer vacation already!
At least we have a three day weekend.
Hope you're having a good day.
Cheers,
