As you are aware a "safety net" type of provision has been included in the master netting agreement to attempt to convert any underlying master agreement one way payment provision to a two way payment provision.
However, this is only a safety net and should not be relied upon.
It may not cover every particular definitional/form structure in an underlying master agreement.
Please be sure to review the underlying master.
It is probably always best to draft a contract specific amendment to convert to 2way payment since this is a critical issue to effect properly the closeout netting and setoff provisions of the master netting agreement.
The specific amendment can be included in the master netting or accomplished as a separate amendment to the underlying master agreement.
Any questions, call me.
