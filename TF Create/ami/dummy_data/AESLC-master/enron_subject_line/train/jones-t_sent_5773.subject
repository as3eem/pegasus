We now have a computer set up so you can view the TradeSpark website.
It is  located in a cubicle across from the C-1 conference room (on the side  opposite of me, at EB3858D).
Since it has taken us so long to get access  into this website, it is critical that each of you review your products  descriptions of the website AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
Can you each please confirm  to me that you have completed your review and if you have any issues with the  product descriptions please pass them on to Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline.
If for any reason you continue to have computer problems, please call Jason,  our floor computer tech, ASAP.
Thanks for your prompt attention to this!
