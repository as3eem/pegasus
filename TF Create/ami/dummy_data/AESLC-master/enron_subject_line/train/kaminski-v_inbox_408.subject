Dear Mr. Kaminski,  Hello, I am producing this year's 'Real Options Training Course' on behalf of the Risk Waters Group in NY.
I am very interested in hearing your comments and suggestions regarding the issues surrounding real options, in addition to hearing what type of research Enron has been doing with real options (as well as a possible speaker position).
Thanks again, I look forward to speaking with you.
Best Regards,
