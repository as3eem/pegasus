The $95MM profit in Power-Canada on Friday turned out to be release of reserves as well, so total reserve release was $803 MM (vs. the $700 we knew of in Frevert meeting).
$500 Gas $208 EES $ 95  Canada Power  5-day P/L $563, so $240 5-day 5-day loss w/o reserve release.
QTD P/L $775, so $28 QTD profit w/o reserve release.
The $500 Gas & $95 Power reserve releases leaves ~$750 MM in North America's Schedule C & D, although most of that is specific deal reserves.
