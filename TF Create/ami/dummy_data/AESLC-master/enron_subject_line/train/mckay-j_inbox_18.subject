The transfer of your securities and mutual funds is in process.
There are a few Canadian items that will not transfer.
You mentioned that you would like to sell the Canadian securities and transfer the cash.
Can you please call Dale Onrait at 250-712-2195 and have him liquidate the Canadian positions and tell him you would like the proceeds and the Candian cash to be converted to US dollars and transfered to RBC Dain Rauscher.
This instruction must come from you.
If you have any questions, please give me a call.
