For your information.
The outcome was great for TW because the Cal.
PUC  adopted our receipt point proposal, eliminating the danger of mandated  restriction of TW's deliveries to the California border.
The outcome is not  so great for Enron overall because they rejected our proposed settlement.
The receipt point proposal was able to survive since it was part of both of  the competing settlements.
I'm still trying to get thru the whole order; let me know if you have  questions.
