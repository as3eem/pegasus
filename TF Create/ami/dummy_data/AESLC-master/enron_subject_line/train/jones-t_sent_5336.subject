We have two new lawyers that have joined our Group today:  Francisco  Pinto-Leite and Frank Sayre.
They will need access to the Financial Trading  Agreement Database.
In addition, I am still waiting to hear that Cheryl  Nelson has been granted access to the Financial Trading Database.
Can you  let me know what the scoop is...?
Also, I left you a message this morning about my new database for online  documents...when can we expect a roll out of that?
People keep sending me  documents and I have no place to record them...
Thanks, as usual for your help!
