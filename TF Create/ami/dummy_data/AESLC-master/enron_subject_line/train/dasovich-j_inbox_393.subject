An attorney for Reliant sent a letter on behalf of five Southern California Edison creditors (Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy, Enron, Puget Sound Energy) to SCE today requesting a meeting to discuss the terms of a forbearance agreement.
The following is the statement we are using with the media:   We are interested in getting paid and in discussing constructive solutions.
This letter is aimed at advancing that.
We have no plans at this time to participate as a petitioning creditor in an involuntary bankruptcy filing.
In fact, this letter is an attempt to avoid bankruptcy.
