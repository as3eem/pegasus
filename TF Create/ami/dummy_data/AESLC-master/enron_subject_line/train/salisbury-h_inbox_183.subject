Our Director of Corporate Travel has informed us that American Express will not be able to establish a new Corporate account for us at this time.
Until we are able to obtain company-sponsored credit cards, when incurring company expenses it will be necessary to use personal credit cards or cash, which can then be submitted for reimbursement through the expense report system.
You may want to refrain from incurring any reimbursable expenses until we receive further assurances from the company that they have the processes in place to pay them.
As information becomes available about administrative operations, I will relay it to you.
Please contact me if you have any questions.
