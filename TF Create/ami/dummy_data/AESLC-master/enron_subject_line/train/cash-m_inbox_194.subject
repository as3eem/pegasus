Michelle,  As a follow on to our previous correspondence on this matter, Enron Metals and Commodity Ltd. (EMCL) has entered into an Incentive Scheme with employees working on EMCL business.
I know that an issue has been raised about payment of incentives to employees on the North American payroll, but we have not received further clarification on the matter, so I would like to send you the "Document" which lists out who is included (by location and payroll) and what the definition of the Scheme is.
To do this, I need your Fax Number.
I am in the office today, but do not plan on being here tomorrow, so if you could send it to me this AM.
Thanks,
