I wanted to thank each of you for participating in the venture group's "Grand Slam" event this week.
It was a big success.
We received very positive feedback from the attendees.
One of our primary objectives was to provide our portfolio companies with further insight into EBS' strategy/business model, and each of your presentations was a key part of telling the Enron/EBS story.
In order for the portfolio companies to develop products that are strategic to EBS, it is imperative that they fully understand our business model.
I know everybody's schedule is very busy, so we appreciate you taking the time.
Regards,
