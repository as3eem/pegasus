Good morning.
Per Michael Tribolet's request, I am forwarding you graphs that display the high level detail of bankruptcy exposure by 1) Business Unit and 2) Enron Corp consolidated.
Regarding the Portland General graph, please note that we currently have knowledge of only one counterparty exposure - PG&E.
Please call me if you have any questions or comments.
Thank you and have a great day.
Regards,
