Tanya:  Our FX desk has requested an ISDA Master Agreement for ENA's FX trades with:   Credit Suisse First Boston, London Branch.
The entity with which ENA already has an executed master (effective 4/21/93)  is Credit Suisse First Boston International, which trades derivatives.
I will have the name of the CSFB lawyer this afternoon.
Can you please prepare a credit worksheet?
Thanks.
