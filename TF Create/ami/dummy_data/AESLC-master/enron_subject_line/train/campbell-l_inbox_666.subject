As noted in the attached Order, the FERC Mediation conference scheduled for this Thursday has been moved to next Tuesday at 10:00 a.m.
In addition, I've attached the most recent Order in the Southeast RTO case.
My understanding is that the ALJ in that case plans to hold three day a week meetings (Tues-Thurs) from now until the deadline imposed by FERC.
Can we be far behind?
