Mike  Attached is the summary of the Carlsbad/Crawford/WT-1 oba.
The balance as of 11/30/2001 is $1,497,337.92 due Transwestern.
This balance will probably grow by an additional $50,000 due TW in 12/2001.
Please let me know if you desire additional detail.
Hopefully we already reconcile.
I will call Sharon Tischer on Wednesday January 2nd to discuss the other balances that exist between TW and DEFSSW - and also the possibility of netting the Hobbs and Artesia payable balances against the Crawford and Waha receivable balances.
