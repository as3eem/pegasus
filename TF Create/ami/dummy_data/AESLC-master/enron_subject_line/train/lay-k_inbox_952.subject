Please open attachment  For all those who do not already know the doorman at the Huntindon, Reuben passed away un expectantly.
Apparently, he contracted Pneumonia which lead to his lungs failing.
He had just celebrated his 60th birthday that weekend.
There is collection being taken up by the staff at the huntingdon to assist with funeral expenses and returning the body to Mexico.
I any of you wish to make a donation you can give it to me and I will see that it gets to the family.
