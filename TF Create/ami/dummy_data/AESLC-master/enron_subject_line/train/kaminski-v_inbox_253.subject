Hey, Vince:  How are you?
I just want to thank your for all your efforts during my application to Enron last year.
Even if it did not work out in the end, but I still appreciate all your help.
I just started my new job at "Allegheny Energy Global Markets" in New York city, the company is the trading arm of Allegheny Energy, and used to be Merrill Lynch's Energy Trading Group.
I will be responsible for structuring.
Again, thanks for the help, I look forward to talking
