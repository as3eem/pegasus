What do you think about Russell's request for a confirm here?
I think this  is really confusing for our Canadian team.
There must be requirements for  the LC if it's an upfront LC, we would need a zero threshold.
I just don't  think this is very straight forward for these poor Candadian girls to figure  out.
What do you think?
