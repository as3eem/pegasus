Justin,  Per the email below, before we respond to Glencore we just wanted to make  sure that you haven't made any agreements with Glencore with respect to  choice of law for the online trades that would subject them to UK law.
I don't want to talk to them without checking with you first since this is  one of the true counterparties that we are trading with on both sides of the  Atlantic.
By the way, I heard you had some really good news.
I'm so happy for you!
