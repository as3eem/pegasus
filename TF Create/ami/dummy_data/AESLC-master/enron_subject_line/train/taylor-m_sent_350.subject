Here are the most recent versions from Clifford Chance.

The PA = Password Application - to be signed by counterparty & sent to us  before a password is issued.
The ETA = Electronic Trading Agreement - to be agreed to online before  trading is permitted.
The ROETA = Read Only ETA - to be agreed to online by persons wishing access  to the site to view but not trade (probably misnamed - should be ROPA or  something that doesn't sound like they'll be able to trade).
