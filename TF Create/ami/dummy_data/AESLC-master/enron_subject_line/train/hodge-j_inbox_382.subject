Hi all!
I am writing an article for the March/April 2002 Trends on the Section's public service activities.
If you would like your committee's public service activities highlighted in the article, just drop me a short E-mail and let me know what you're doing, and I'll include it in the article.
Please E-mail  your information to me by COB Monday, 12/17.
Thanks.
Happy holidays!
