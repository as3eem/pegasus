Dear Ken,  One or two participants in the dinner have inquired as to whether the event will still take place in light of the tragedy of September 11.
The answer is a resounding "yes"!
There could not be a more important time for financial and business leaders to gather to discuss some of the major challenges facing the global economy, and so we are moving full steam ahead with arrangements.
Closer to the event we will be sending you some of the issues that we plan to raise for discussion.
Bill McDonough, Lord John Browne, and I are greatly looking forward to seeing you there.
Just to remind you of the time and location:  	National Portrait Gallery 	St Martin's Place 	London WC2H OHE  	7:00 -7:45 p.m. 	 Cocktails (Tudor Galleries, second floor)
