Attached for your review and comments is a revised Confirmation for the EES Weather (snowfall cap option) product.
I have also attached a blackline against the last draft distributed, as well as a copy of the last Terms and Conditions distributed (unchanged from prior draft) and the Credit Support Annex (also unchanged from prior draft).
Unless informed otherwise, this product is scheduled for release no later than tomorrow so kindly send any comments to my attention ASAP, or let me know if you require additional review time.
Please note also that the foregoing is not intended to imply that other procedures and approvals (eg.
RAC Approval), if any, required for the introduction of new products by EES' / EWS' policies have been completed.
Thanks,
