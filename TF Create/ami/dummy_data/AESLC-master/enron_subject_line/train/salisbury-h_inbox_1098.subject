Because I have to go to a PRC meeting all Day, and Donald will be out that Day,  here is the plan:  Stacy moves to MidC to train with Donald all next week,   Cara schedules the Rockies all next week  When Donald Returns, he trains with Cara until he is ready to take over, and then takes the Rockies.
We wanted to do it anyway, now we have a reason.
