As you are aware, we are in the process of rescheduling the Enron Corp. Board of Directors meeting.
Due to the proximity of the Holidays we will hold committee meetings and Board meeting on the same day.
Therefore, please let us know today the minimum amount of time you would need for your respective committee meetings.
Please be aware that some of our Directors will be joining the meeting via teleconference and we will therefore need to do all mail outs at least one week in advance.
As soon as we have a firm date for the Board meeting, we will advise you.
Thank you.
