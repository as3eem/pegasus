We are deeply saddened by the tragic events of September 11th.
No doubt each of us has been affected personally in some way by this.
We would like to report that our offices are presently fully operational and you can reach us by phone, fax or e-mail to address any concerns you may have.
Please let us know if there is any way we can be of assistance to you.
Our strongest support and deepest sympathies go out to all our industry colleagues who have endured the horrors of these past days.
