I understand that some of you who attended the October 11 meeting of the RFF Board of Directors requested a copy of Ramanan Laxminarayan's presentation on the economics of antibiotic resistance.
Please let me know if you would like to receive a copy and if so, if you prefer to receive the slides in hard copy or via email.
Thanks so much!
