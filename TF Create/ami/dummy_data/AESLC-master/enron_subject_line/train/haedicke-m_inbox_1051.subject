I have a concern about Enron's forward-looking exposure associated with legacy deals (deals that existed during the June 2000 through the May 2001 price shock).
If Edison gets its way, all customers will pay for Edison's under-recovery from June 2000 through January 2001 plus CDWR spot market purchases during 2001.
This would take the form of a surcharge on future bills.
My concern is that Enron will be on the hook for these future charges associated with past under-collections -- even beyond the term of our legacy deals.
For example, if a deal ends in March 2002 we could be on the hook for surcharges that a legacy customer would receive on its bill after that date, provided the surcharge pertained to costs incurred by the utility during the time that the legacy customer was ours.
