At the recent DES meeting, I was given the assignment to draft a letter that could be used as a courtesy notification to state agencies of turbine change outs.
(This is for states where permitting is not required for turbine change outs.)
Attached is that letter.
The parenthetical comments are added to explain certain aspects of the letter and would not be included in the letter.
At a minimum, this letter will be sent for all turbine change outs.
Call me (402-398-7716) if you have any questions.
