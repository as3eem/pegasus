Mr. Bonner -  Attached is a new Confidentiality Agreement between SunGard Trading & Risk Systems and EnronOnline/Enron Net Works.
This agreement is being provided in order to enable current discussions to move forward and to facilitate the work contemplated in the 10/24 letter forwarded by Mr. Popp.
I realize we have an existing CA with Automated Securities Clearance, Ltd.; however, since this entity is not the same as STRS, a new agreement has been proposed.
If discussions between the parties result in the involvement of other SunGard entities, we can address this at that time by either providing new agreements for each entity or amending the attached to encompass the new entities.
Please have the attached reviewed at your convenience and let me know if SunGard should have any comments or questions.
Thanks for your assistance.
