When: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:00 AM-9:30 AM (GMT-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada); Tijuana.
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  The current plan is to not have a separate Enron witness but to participate with a group of marketer/generators.
The planned speaker on behalf of this group is Richard Tabors.
I would like to caucus with you to make sure we're ok with this.
