Susan, please substitute the setoff language set forth in the attached to each of the referenced items in the swap form bank.
If there are any other items in the swap form bank that you think also need the new language, please advise.
There may be additional language for a Canadian alternative; Peter is reviewing this further with Canadian counsel.
Susan, also please note that as I update the US Industrial I will include this new language, but for now, put it in the current US Industrial form.
After you have substituted the language, please provide me with one copy of each form for a final check.
Thank you.
Mark Taylor:  This language has not been implemented in EOL.
