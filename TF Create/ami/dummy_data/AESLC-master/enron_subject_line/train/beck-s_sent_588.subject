Mike & Scott,  Sally asked me to forward this to you & wanted to know if there was any way  possible you could attend.
I apologize for the short notice, but with Sally  going out of the country, things have been really hectic.
Sheila Glover  will also be attending.
Please let me know as soon as possible & I will let Paige know.
Thanks,
