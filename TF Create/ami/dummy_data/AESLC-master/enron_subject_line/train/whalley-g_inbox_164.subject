Greg, we maybe should discuss - I don't know that I disagree with Rogers action.
My understanding is that we have added $10/MWhr premium on all deals until further notice;  however, the impact of possible customer decision delays, un-available curves and the resulting idle sales force could cause a significant issue for Q3 retail financials.
If the net result is some downtime for a couple days probably no problem - if it is more than a couple days it is very difficult to catch up.
I will keep you in the loop.
Regards
