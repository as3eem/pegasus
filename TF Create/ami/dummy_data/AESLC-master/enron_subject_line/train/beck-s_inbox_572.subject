Jeff / Sally,  Shona just informed me that I missed the Steering Comittee meeting yesterday....
I remember getting an e-mail from you (Jeff) announcing that they were going to happen and that we should prepare for them, ....but I don't remember getting an invite for an actual meeting.
I've been on vacation, and when I came back I could have easily deleted the invite by accident, in an attempt to quickly get through my two hundred e-mails, so if I did, I apologise for not attending!
Could you please let me know when the next would be and what the frequency would be going forward?
regards
