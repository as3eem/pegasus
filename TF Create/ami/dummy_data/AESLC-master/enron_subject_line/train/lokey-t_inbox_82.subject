Sorry to have taken your time with this.
Please thank Zelda again for me for  helping out and returning my telephone call, which I asked her to do.
Hope it  was okay for her to make the long-distance call here.
I'm so pleased to have  Mother riding to Texas with me, especially since I've been so tired lately.
Thanks again.
