Hi everyone,  The Risk is in the process of adding the daily price for the front month into the existing price report.
Besides the existing Region curves, we could also add several more frequently used Basis curves in this report if it's necessary.
So we would like your input on what Basis curves you think would be helpful to be added to the new report.
Thanks for your help and please let me know by the end of today.
