Holden,  Can you look at this deal, 602737.1.
It's not comming through on the CARP report even after I schedule it and PNM is wondering why.
Also, a purchase for $58 27 mw's isn't in the system and they are seeing it.
I'm not sure how Parking and lending deals are entered in the system, but somthing looks out of wack  thanks
