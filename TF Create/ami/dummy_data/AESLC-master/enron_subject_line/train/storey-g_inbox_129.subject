To begin the Inception phase of our CGS project, the Statement of Work is near completion.
I am sending the final version to the project team (to include the business unit sponsors).
In a couple of days our goal is to have a meeting to discuss any issues and sign off on the document.
Please contact me with any questions.
Thank you,
