Seems to be a consensus among those of you I heard from that Jaliscience is the place to be tonight.
If there are people who think this idea sucks, I am more than willing to alter plans.
But, as of now, we'll meet up at Jaliscience about 9:00.
I'll call Clay when I get into town, so he can be the go to guy for questions, etc.
You're welcome Clay.
See you tonight.

Jolly Science anyone?
