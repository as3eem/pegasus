Hunter,  Thanks again for the Coffee.
I really enjoyed hearing your take on the industry and actually I really enjoyed your interview as well.
I love to debate - especially economic theory/politics - which made your interview amazing to me.
Quick Question, I apologize for not having a pen when we grabbed coffee.
I'm having difficulty remembering the books you recommended.
Would you remind again?
Jason
