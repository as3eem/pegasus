There exists another receivable financing covering power receivables structured at the corporate level.
I am working with Trey Cash and Melinda Winn to extract the receivables to enable the master netting agreements to be executed.
For now, please touch base with me prior to initialing any master netting that includes power.
Please note we are still working on the extraction from the gas receivables as well.
