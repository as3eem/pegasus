Jason:  Please let me know where we stand on this and what steps we are  currently taking to finalize.
On a different matter, I spoke with Mike Neves on Friday afternoon and we  concluded that getting you hooked up to Lotus Notes was becoming too  complicated.
Please email your updates to me and I will enter onto Lotus  Notes.
Thanks.
Sara
