I know we have moved this meeting already, but since I have very little info ( only what I read on Yahoo!)
I think we should wait till next week to meet.
So I am going to cancel.
I have given Leslie, Jeff , Stacey and Rita,  Enron BUCKS cards.
Make them buy you a drink.
Let me know if you hear anything.
Thanks for you patients and continued understanding.
