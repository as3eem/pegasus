I'm leaving now!
Teresa, Larry, Lillian, Irene and I have closed down for a few days.
We've satisfied all the demands of the bankruptcy attorneys, and Dan Lyons and Travis McCullough -  no mean feat!
I'm hoping to be out until Thursday, but I'll check my email and voicemail on Wednesday and come in if necessary.
Home number: 713 528-0232.
Ho!Ho!Ho!
