Attached is a file showing depreciation for NNG Commercial after excluding depreciation for the capital dollars associated with rate case settlement (lines 13-16).
The 2002 depreciation is calculated to be $4.379 million.
I think philosophically it s a good idea to track capital projects within NNG Commercial based on the life of the contracts used to justify the project.
I don't think Neubauer is quite there yet.
My concern is that we have developed an IBIT  target for 2002 by using a 2001 number that does not include depreciation.
It seems that we ought to offset the 01 starting point by the amount of the 02 depreciation.
Lets talk further with Rod.
