Frank and Francisco:  Haven't seen you two in awhile!
ENA is considering a financial deal with an offshore entity located in  Panama.
We have no research for this jurisdiction.
I will need to hire  local counsel and send a deriviatives questionnaire for response.
Have you  used Panamanian counsel before?
Please send info.
