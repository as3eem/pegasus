Dear Ken:  Leo Linbeck III told me of your thoughtful phone call regarding The Institute for Advanced Study in Musical Theatre.
I understand your priorities and look forward to our ongoing relationship.
Towards that end please allow me to reiterate my invitation for you to join the Board of Trustees.
We would be proud to share our camaraderie and you can look forward to discussing freedom and collaboration*, without commercial interruption.
Warmest personal regards,  Stuart   *Attached  - ken lay
