Hi, Sara.
I hope you had a wonderful holiday weekend.
During our discussion on 11/14, you asked that we provide you with a prime brokerage fee schedule.
I'm working with one of the trading assistants to find one for you, but we're having some difficulty.
If I'm unable to supply you with a fee schedule, is there a specific way you would like to word Paragraph 9 "Fees and Charges" (other than the phrase "as agreed by the parties from time to time")?
If you would like to keep your previously proposed wording, I can run it by Legal one more time with an explanation of the difficulty we're having.
Thanks so much for your patience,
