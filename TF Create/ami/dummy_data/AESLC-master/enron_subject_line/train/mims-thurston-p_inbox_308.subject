Hi Patrice,  I know it's never going to be a good time to take care of this deal, but we've got to do it sometime.
Let me know what time is good for you.
Please let me know the payment terms of the new deal, so that I can get with the new coordinator of this account.
More specifically, are they still prepaying???
Since the name changed to "c," I will no longer be handling it.
Bummer, huh?
Thanks!
