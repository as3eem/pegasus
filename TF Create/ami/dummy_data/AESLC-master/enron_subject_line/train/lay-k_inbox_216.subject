I understand that you may be limited on what business aspects you would want to discuss.....but we want you to know that if you would like to discuss any personal issues at the meeting or anytime...your forum members are with you any time....confidential, of course.
Let me know if there is ever anything we can do.
Warm Regards,  Richard et al
