Hi.
I am an employee at Enron and I have applied for an infant spot in the  new day care center.
I was wondering when we would be notified as to whether  or not we have been accepted.
I know the center doesn't open until  September, but for me it will be first time child care and I need to line  something up if I do not get in.
Also , do you know an exact date for the  scheduled opening?
Thanks for your help.
