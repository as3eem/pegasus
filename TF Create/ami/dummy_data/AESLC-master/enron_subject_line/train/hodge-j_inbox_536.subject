Jeff:  here's the SOCO netting agreement that I've negotiated with Rob Markham for physical power.
please give me a call with any questions.
Note that I followed up on the power receivable when I negotiated this agreement and will forward the executed agreement to Lech Kalembka so that he can take care of filing any required financing statements.
