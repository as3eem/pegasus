Attached is an email I got from the lawyer for Fletcher Challenge.
Obviously, he is on a short time frame, so we need to respond rather  quickly.
Russell, we need some direction from Credit on how we want to  proceed on this assignment.
Do you want to meet to go over this, and maybe  give Bert a call, or what...?
Please let us know.
