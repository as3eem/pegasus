VaR for total power has decreased from $41.9 M to $38.7M.
VaR for the west desk has decreased from $22.7 to $21  Decrease in var for the west desk is due partially to decrease in intra month vol curves (significant change in Aug component var for the NW-LT and NW-ST books) and decrease in overall short position.
