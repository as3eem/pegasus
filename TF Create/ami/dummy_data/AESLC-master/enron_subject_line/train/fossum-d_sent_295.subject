DOE indicated that their current  PNM rate is "5.3 cents, exclusive of the demand charge."
Tino's consultant  claims that factoring in the demand charge yields an effective rate of  approximately 7 cents/KWh.

This is at the high end of the  range we hoped they'd be in.
Additionally, DOE indicated that they need "redundancy" and don't want to  rely on PNM for back up power.
They want a multiple turbine facility--i.e.,
