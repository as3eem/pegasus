Janet, we have been down the road with these guys before and it was not very  pleasant.
I think it is hightly unlikely that Larry will be coming up with  an additional 7FA turbine - but you can call him.
I'm also starting to think  as the LM position starts to get better managed that maybe you and Chris  should take the D5's and 7EA's onto your book.
Something to think about, I  am just concerned about your ability to manage more complex deals without  some resource availability.
I think you have to feel pretty good about the  LM position first.
Something to think about?
Regards
