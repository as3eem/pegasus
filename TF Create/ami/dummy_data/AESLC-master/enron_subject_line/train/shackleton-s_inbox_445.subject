Sara and Susan, Can I set up a 20 minute meeting with both of you to discuss an automated FX Trading system we are thinking about for the London office.
Shane Dallmann, head of the UK Rate & Currency desk is in town this week.
Susan, I am not sure if this is your world or not for TAX.
Thanks.
Sheila
