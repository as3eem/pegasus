The following is a web address of a magazine based in Whistler, Canada.
A woman that I work closely with, Janet Love Morrison, is a huge human rights activist and during December's semester break she traveled to Burma.
Her article is the 1st in a series of 4 and is the feature article, titled "Following the Path of Aung San Suu Kye."
i thought it was rather impressive and so is she; I truly admire her courage.
www.piquenewsmagazine.com  Take a look as soon as possible... its the feature of the week and may not be up much longer.
I will let you know when her next is published and posted.
