There is a 25 mw heavy load schedule that BPA is generating (contract# 23928) and SPP sinks at Humbolt.
The schedule is going real-time because SPP reported the transmission incorrectly to AVA transmission group.
We bought from BPA Deal # 486140.1 and sold to SPP Deal # 610573.1.
Please refer to SPP tag number #2848.
Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out.
Thanks,
