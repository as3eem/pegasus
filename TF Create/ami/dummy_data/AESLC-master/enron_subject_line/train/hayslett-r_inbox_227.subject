Re the due diligence request: Historical management financials w comparisons to budget..." =  Not Available  We have financial comparisions (income) to the most recent current estimate at that time, but not the original budget.
Also, NNG management reports are NOT legal entity, but are "NNG Group", which is inclusive of ENE's investment in Trailblazer and Overthrust.
Our only true legal entity financials are historical comparatives and only prepared quarterly and annually for noteholders, and annually for the FERC (Form2).
Comments??
