RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  The NYISO requires additional time to reconcile settlement balances for the January 2000 2nd settlement adjustment.
As a result, issuances of invoices for the January 2000 2nd settlement adjustment are being delayed.
It is anticipated that invoices for the January 2000 2nd settlement adjustment will be posted by 23:00, Monday, October 15, 2001.
The NYISO apologizes for any inconveniences caused by this delay.
