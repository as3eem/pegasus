Ken,  In the midst of all the criticism of the company and noise from all sides, I wanted to let you know I think of you often, reflect on the occasions when I have been at the table as you sorted through difficult situations and have the utmost confidence in your ability to do so again.
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help-with RFF or otherwise.
Dod
