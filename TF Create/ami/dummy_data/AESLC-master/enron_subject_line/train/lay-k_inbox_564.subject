As a follow-up to our meeting yesterday, I thought you might be interested in the attached letter that John Kelley just received from the Stuttgart, Germany group that is also bidding for the 2012 Olympics.
They were very impressed with the concept of converting the Astrodome to a track and field facility, and they evidently are considering a similar stadium as part of their bid for the 2012 Olympics.
This seems to underscore the importance of Houston moving quickly to make the conversion of the Astrodome so that we do not lose our competitive advantage.
