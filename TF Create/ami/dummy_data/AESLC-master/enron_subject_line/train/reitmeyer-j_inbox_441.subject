I am about to leave to go to the store.
Mimi is at our house.
I can't get a hold of anyone about counseling.
I have left several messages.
My day started out ok, but I feel like I am about to loose it again.
Please call me on my cell phone if you have time to talk.
I guess I just need some reassurance that we will be able to fix this if we work very hard.
I just want you to believe that.
heart me
