Dear Kelly,  My name is Carole Frank and I am in West Risk Management for natural gas.
I spoke with Russ about a request I had and he referred me to you.
My trader needs a rate server handle set up for the Gas Daily Published point "PSCo citygate".
My trader entered a deal with this point and someone in confirmations informed me that SITARA said it was an invalid index.
Please help!
