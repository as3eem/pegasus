RE the message attached from Brian Swinford, Lynn advises that you are  familiar with CIESA (I am not!).
I don't know anything about a prior  interest rate swap.
By copy of this e-mail I am asking Pat Cini to suggest  how we might proceed.
If you have further information, please let us know.
Thanks.
