Beginning 8/29/01, we have updated our processes and will be reporting Notifications and Violations on the Executive Reports Viewer for 8/28/01 reporting.
This process eliminates the need to e-mail MS Word and MS Excel documents.
In place of the Word and Excel documents, you will receive an e-mail with a link to the Reports Viewer.
If you do not have access to the Executive Reports Viewer, or have a question about your access level, please contact Chris Abel (3-3102) or myself (5-4541).
Thank You
