Andrew-  I have created a draft of our RisktRAC book setup spreadsheet for East Power.
Can you take a look at it and see if everything is accurate.
One issue I have relates to the 'Trading Location' field.
We had previously used 'US Power East', but this is not part of the dropdown menu in the field.
Has this location been changed to something else?
Thanks!
