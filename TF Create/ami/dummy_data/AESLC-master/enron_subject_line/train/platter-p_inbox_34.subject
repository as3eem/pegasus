Serena, Attached is the new scheduling sheet to point to the new databases for the ESTATE.
The current Excel models will work until the final seperation between Enron and UBSW (Next Thursday).
I do not know who is responsible for the Estate scheduling, but fowarding it to you for now.
More than likely, the sheet I am sending you will not work since you do not have access to the database.
If you have the final answer to who will be doing the Scheduling the Estate, please send me and CC an Email to Sonny Seaton requesting access to SQDV001d Scheduling database.
Thanks,
