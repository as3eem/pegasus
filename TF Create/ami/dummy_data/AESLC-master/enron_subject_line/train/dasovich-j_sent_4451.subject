Received a call this afternoon from Gordon Smith, CEO of PG&E (I met Gordon  when he was CFO of PG&E and I was a bureaucrat at the PUC working on the Blue  Book).
He was following up from the meeting this morning with Bob Glynn.
He  was very positive about the comprehensive solution that Ken Lay described to  Glynn at this morning's meeting.
He was particularly positive about the  core/noncore proposal.
He asked to meet to discuss it further.
I have an  appointment to meet with him Monday afternoon.
He offered--as a board member
