As promised, attached is the second update on our British Energy hedging program.
We have been very successful in the last few weeks moving a number of deals forward.
Other retail marketers are starting to come out of the woodwork to purchase power for retail intitiatives.
The pending deals listed are those with >50% probability of closing.
Obviously, none of these deals are binding, and as we execute some of these, we will re-evaluate the position.
Cheers, Paul D
