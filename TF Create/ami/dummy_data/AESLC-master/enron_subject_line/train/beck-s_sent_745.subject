Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since  March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.
All  business voice mail messages require a prompt response from our business  unit.
Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following  tasks:  1)  Please grant Vanessa Schulte access to Mary Solmonson's voice mail so  that she change the access code for retrieving messages so that she can  review any incoming voice mail messages and deliver appropriate business  responses.
