I have asked Patti to send Sharron a list of all employees within Energy  Operations (a BIG list) and another one with managers and above (perhaps a  more manageable list) for this effort.
Since you went to the meeting I  didn't know whether or not you were following up on this.
Just wanted to let  you know that I have asked Patti to do this.
Thanks.
