Congratulations go out  to the Cartel for winning this year's Superbowl.
The Cartel  beat the River Rats with a final score of 87 to 73.
Everybody who won money this year go bug Matt about it as I am not handling the finances of the league!
Scott while your collecting your money, tell Matt to get your name put on the trophy.
