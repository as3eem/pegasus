David,  Could you please review the following agreement.
Specifically  Paragraph 11 which covers insurance.
ReUse will be providing ash handling  services under this agreement.
This same agreement will be used for both   Lumbertown Power, LLC and Elizabethtown Power, LLC.
These are the power  plants in the Alamac transaction.
We are looking at replacing the existing  Ash and Coal handling agreements with new ones.
Let me know if you have any  questions.
