" To dream anything that you want to dream -       that is the beauty of the human mind.
To do anything you want to do -      that is the strength of the human will.
To trust yourself to test your limits -       that is the courage to succeed."
" Embrace hard things and your mind will blossom."
"This is America ENRON.
We can do anything here."
-- Ted Turner   Sunil Dalal
