Richard,  The attached resume is from an attorney who is a friend of an  Associate here at Enron.
I had worked with the Associate before but don't  know his friend.
I told the Associate that I wasn't sure of our hiring  needs, but that I would pass the resume along.
Barbara indicated you were  our recruiting coordinator.
So here it is.
