Gerald/Debra,  There is one additional change to the amendment that you are working on for Jill Zivley for the Aspect, Helmrick & Payne, etc.
contract.
We need to include a MDQ of 16,000 MMBtu/day.
Also, could you please let me know approximately how long it will take to be able to provide Jill with a draft to send to the customer?
We need to get something to the customer on Monday if at all possible.
Thanks,
