Mark - Attached you'll find the spreadsheet you sent me with notes I've added on  each deal discrepancy.
Most had already been solved, and a few pertain to  Real Time spreadsheets, in which case I'll defer to Bill Williams.
Please let  me know if you have questions on any of my notes.
If not, I believe we should  be all set for March.
Thanks for your patience,
