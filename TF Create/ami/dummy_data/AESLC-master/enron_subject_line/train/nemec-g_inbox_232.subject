Gerald,  I just spoke with Tina Horn from the Cameron Parish.
They received the letter voiding the original agreement.
She said that since using it for potable water was the only use they had in mind, they won't be needing the ROA to the pipeline.
(Actually, she told me that their engineer had told them that it would be possible to clean the pipeline to the point that it could be used for potable water.)
In light of this, could you please look into the procedures for abandoning the pipeline according to Louisiana law?
Thanks for your help,
