Good Morning,  NOB is derated to Zero for HE 5-12 for Saturday July 28th.
Our Downstreams at NOB are cut to zero for those hours, and the deal numbers have been changed and noted in scheduling.
The deals are:  Nevada Power 423713.1   BPA  459815.1  LADWP 579025.1 and 548842.1   Special Conditions on LDWP deal 541395.1 require that we re-supply them at a different and mutually agreed upon delivery point.
Sean and Art from LDWP agreed that this alternate delivery would be COB, and this deal has been adjusted to show HE 7-12 is at COB N/S now.
Please see me if you have any questions regarding these deals.
