Jackie - Woodward is calling....contract #33175 has deliveries to Canon City, 60 dth per day, and I see it on your spread sheet, but it is not in path manager, and not on the contract.
Can you please look into this asap.
The guy at Woodward is wanting a call back from Paul Lucci today.
Thanks, Gloria
