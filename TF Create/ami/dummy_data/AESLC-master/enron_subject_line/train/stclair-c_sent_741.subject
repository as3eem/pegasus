Leslie and Elizabeth: I should have sent this to you as well.
Could you please take a look at  this form and let me know if it is okay with you?
Seems like there are more  situations that are coming up where our counterparties are wanted to execute  1 Guaranty to cover all types of transactions and this is our attempt to  develop a form that credit can use.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Carol
