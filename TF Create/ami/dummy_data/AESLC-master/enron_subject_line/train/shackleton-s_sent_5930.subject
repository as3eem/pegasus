Subsequent to our swap group meeting with Clement last week, I have discussed  the issue further with Jeff Hodge, Peter Keohane, Russell Diamond and Clem.
In addition to ENA, ECC is feeling the pressure of delays for obtaining  corporate guaranties caused by increased guaranty requests, too few signers  and insufficient legal staffing to handle the volume.
Although Clem will have assistance soon, we concluded that it would be  prudent to begin negotiation of a guaranty immediately rather than wait for  the conclusion of the master agreement (or confirmation) negotiations.
Please try to incorporate this approach, particularly with Canadian  counterparties.
Credit will continue to push our internal form of Enron Corp. guaranty.
