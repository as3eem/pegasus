Rod and Paul: I have checked the ISDA between Kaiser and ENA and it has our standard setoff  language which permits setoff of amounts owed by or to the Non-Defaulting  Party and its Affiliates against amounts owed by or to the Defaulting Party  under the ISDA and other agreements.
Please call me once you have located  the Metals agreement as Greg indicated to me in a voice mail that he needs an  answer this morning.
Rod, If we get comfortable on the legal side with this arrangement, are there  other credit issues that need to be considered?
