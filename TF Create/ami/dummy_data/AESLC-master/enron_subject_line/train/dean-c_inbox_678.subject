Group,  Just wanted to give you an update on the Wheelabrator Martel outage.
They are currently only producing 9mw (they are prescheduled at 13mw), and we are selling them 4mw back real-time in order to cover their preschedule.
I just spoke with Mike Burt at the plant, and he said that they will continue producing 9mw through HE4 on Thursday, 9/27.
Beginning HE5, they will be going down to 0mw, so at that point we need to sell them 13mw, through HE16.
At that point in time they should be back to full power and producing 13mw (their full preschedule).
I'll keep you posted on any changes.
Thanks,
