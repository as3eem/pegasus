Market Notice October 29, 2001  Market Participants:    The ISO has been notified that effective HE0800 (beginning at 0700) October 30, 2001, CERS will no longer provide creditworthy backing of negative decremental energy bids and negative OOM sales (i.e.
any bids below zero dollars).
If for reliability purposes, the ISO needs a negative decremental energy bid, CERS has indicated to the ISO that it may back such bids on a case-by-case basis at its sole discretion.
Accordingly, in continuing compliance with FERC's orders, the ISO will not dispatch any negative decremental energy bids or any negative OOM sales absent assurances of creditworthy backing.
Please contact your Client Representative with any questions.
