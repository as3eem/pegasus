Attached is a preliminary draft of the letter prepared by Gibbs & Bruns  notifying TVA of the occurrence of a Triggering Event and EMPI's suspension  of deliveries under the MOPA.
Please review and call me with any questions  or comments.
We will need to carefully consider EPMI's offer to provide  energy under the MOPA at market based rates.
As you are aware,  the current  plan is to send TVA  notice on Jan. 4th.
The draft of the control area  petition should be ready for circulation on  Tuesday, the 28th.
Once received, I will forward both the petition and a  revised draft of this letter to legal, regulatory and trading for review.
