Sara,  Per your conversation with Phil Levy, attached please find our proposed amendment to the Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement currently in place between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.
I have reviewed the definition of "Specified Swap" as defined in Part 1(2) of the Schedule and it does not appear to include foreign exchange transactions.
Therefore, I have modified the definition in the amendment.
Please review the amendment and, if satisfactory, arrange for the execution of two copies.
Both copies should then be returned to my attention at 270 Park Avenue, 40th Floor, New York, New York 10017.
In addition, once executed, I would appreciate your faxing me a copy at 212-270-7368.
Once I receive the originals and have them executed by Chase, I will return to you one fully executed original for your files.
