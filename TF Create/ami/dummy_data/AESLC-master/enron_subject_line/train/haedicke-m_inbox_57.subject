Mark  Although the Xcelerator has been moved to Corp, Jim Derrick asked that I continue to receive legal support from your group.
I and people in my group have worked some with Teresa Bushman and Angela Davis in Lance Schuler's group.
Would you like me to consider Lance or someone in his group as my legal "point person", or is there someone else you'd prefer?
Thanks
