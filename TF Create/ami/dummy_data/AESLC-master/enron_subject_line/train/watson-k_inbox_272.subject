This note is a perfect example of how far behind I am on doing those things that need to be do.
.
.Needless to say, I'm LOSING !!
By now you probably know we have our unit listed with Rosie.
Patsy is much easier to live with now that I see the things the way she does !!
All this does mean I need to resign from the Board and from serving as the Board representative to the Social Committee.
Do you have any preferences as to the date I do that ?
