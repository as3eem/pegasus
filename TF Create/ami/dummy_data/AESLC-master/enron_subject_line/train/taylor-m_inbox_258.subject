I am attaching a structure chart showing what we think would be the best alternative for the swapco transaction (if necessary).
This structure would require ESVL Corp. to obtain a FERC Power Marketing Certificate and would be the actual operating entity.
We are also indifferent if instead of the corporation we use another LLC as the operating company below ERMT LLC.
Let me know when you will be available this afternoon to discuss the attached and the required documentation.
It is in Visio format, so if you can't open it, let me know and I can fax it to you if you give me a confidential fax number.
Thanks.
