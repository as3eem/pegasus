Thank you for a great time!
We enjoyed ourselves so much, it was an absolute  treat!
I love our little barrio!
It's the absolute best in town.
John & I  appreciate being invited to all the fabulous festivities this season (I mean  it, Richard) & we hope to one day return the cheer.
Feliz Navidad y Prospero Ano Nuevo, Queridos Amigos!
and William.....Que te cresca el _ _ _ _ !
