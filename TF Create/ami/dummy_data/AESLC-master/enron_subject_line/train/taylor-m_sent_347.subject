It turns out that quite a bit has been happening without us so we may be  inundated with information over the next day or so.
Let me know if the  message below does not come through in color since it will be difficult to  decipher.
Louise is quite anxious to finalize the ETA, PA and Read-only PA and I  explained that we were still waiting for the proposed changes from London.
Knowing Louise I have a feeling we may see that stuff soon.
Since we seem to be a bit behind schedule, Louise agreed that an all-hands  legal meeting next week might be premature and she is contacting the London  team to discuss scheduling.
I'll let you know as soon as I have anything  more to report on the calendar.
Mark
