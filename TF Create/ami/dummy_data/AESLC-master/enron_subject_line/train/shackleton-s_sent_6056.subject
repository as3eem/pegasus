Gail:  The commercial team is pressuring for a fairly quick implementation of a repo  agreement.
If the consent which I sent yesterday is not satisfactory, please  advise as soon as possible so that I can obtain a repo specific consent.
Also, could you please submit repo documents to me for review.
I do not know who may have contacted you from the London group (Enron Credit  Ltd.) but we can surely coordinate.
That entity should have its own form of  unanimous consent or resolution.
Thanks for your help.
