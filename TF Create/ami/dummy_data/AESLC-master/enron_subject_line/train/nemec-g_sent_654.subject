For completeness,  Attached are the operational documents that reflect the  Gallup Amendments.
The Gas Price Letter reflects TW's agreement to provide  incremental gas volumes.
The confirms to the existing Enfolio deals reflect  the value for the gas which flows from Enron North America Corp. to Enron  Compression Services Corp. and finally to the LLC.
The confirms done with  the original Gallup Transaction are not being amended.
New confirms are  being added to handle the incremental gas from TW.
Please let me know if you  have any questions.
