I think that the BOE should be admitted to membership.
Also, Bob, about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), following the recent seminar we did for them in HK, I think that we are likely to hear more from them about membership.
Frankly, it is easy for me to raise the issue with David Carse/Simon Topping, which might well precipitate a formal application, but obviously I would rather not do so without hearing further from the Board about the potential success of such an application.
It is probably best if I write separately about the HKMA and its functions including why membership for them might make sense.
At that point, further discussion would be useful.
