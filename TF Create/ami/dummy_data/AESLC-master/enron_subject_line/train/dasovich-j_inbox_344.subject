Announcement for E283-1: Real Estate Finance:  Those of you who were present yesterday during the class should already have them.
I have some left over copies of the 2 next sets of lecture notes (Commercial Mortgages and REITS) and a copy of the next case.
If you did not make it to the class yesterday you can pick up your copy of everything at the door of my office (F625).
You will also notice the spreadsheet in the handouts section.
There can be various ways to tackle cases.
This spreadsheet parallels what Dennis and Co. did.
Regards,
