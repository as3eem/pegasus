After our meeting yesterday, I asked Mark Taylor whether under the revised  version of the CEA there was any restriction on one's ability to cash settle  physical transactions.
He confirmed that so long as the parties to the  transaction are "Eligible Contract Participants", then there is no  restriction and our physical contracts can expressly permit cash settlement.
Enclosed is a summary of the ECP definition.
