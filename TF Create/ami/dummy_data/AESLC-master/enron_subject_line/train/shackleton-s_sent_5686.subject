Is anyone familiar with an ISDA Master Agreement executed between ENA and the  above company?
I have received a Security Agreement executed by this party  seeking ENA's signature and the document references the Endorsement (to a  policy  - what policy?)
issued to ENA on 10/19/00 which defines the ISDA  agreement.
This could be related to credit activity in London.
I am waiting  to hear from Jeff Kinneman and Denis O'Connell.
