MRyanTaber@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Pricing Issues Task Force Members,  After today's meeting of the  Pricing Issues Task Force it was decided that the meeting previously scheduled for 9/25 should be cancelled in favor of bringing the issue to a larger group in the form of a joint S&P and Market Structure meeting on October 4th.
Short term recommendations for actions in response to the BME/SCD pricing issues will be considered under the scope of the S&PWG while longer term BME/SCD issues, which has been a topic on the MSWG's agenda, will continue to be addressed by that working group.
