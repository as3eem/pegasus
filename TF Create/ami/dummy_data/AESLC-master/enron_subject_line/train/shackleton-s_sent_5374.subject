Bob:    Thanks for the memo and we should discuss in a future meeting dedicated to  form changes.
If we adopt the 2000 Definitions in our Schedule, we will also need to change  the existing reference in Part 6(f)(iii) to "Negotiated Fallback" (to Section  7.5(c)(iv))  Also, the term "Relevant Price" is used in the "Negotiated Fallback"  definition.
We should clarify whether we need to retain Part 6(f)(iv) of the  Schedule when using "Negotiated Fallback" or whether we intend that "Fallback  Reference Dealers" be an entirely separate and distinct fallback (i.e.
the  4th fallback in our Schedule).
