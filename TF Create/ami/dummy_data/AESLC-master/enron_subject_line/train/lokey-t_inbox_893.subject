Please find the attached file with three individual spreadsheets in response to the items required under the FERC monthly California Report.
I have made no changes to the preliminary file sent out for review on January 11th since I did not receive any comments.
If any corrections are necessary, please notify me and Jeanette Doll, who will be preparing the filing.
Thanks,
