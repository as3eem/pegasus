Phil, I have attached a presentation that I threw together for the Calgary office regarding Rockies fundamentals.
It doesn't flow particularly well, but it contains the most significant information from a few different prior presentations relating to the Rockies.
Thought it might be useful as you work on the "Fundamentals Packet".
Give me a call if you have any questions.
