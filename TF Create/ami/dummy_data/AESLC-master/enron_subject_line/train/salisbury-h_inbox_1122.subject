Dear All,  Today we have calculated and entered the annuity to account for CSU transfer from LT-SW to ST-WROCK for June 2001.
Here are the specifics:  Deal # 630226.1 Amount: $2,981,238 LT-SW will be paying ST-WROCK for the position transferred.
The economics will be reflected in your P&L as of 6/1/2001.
In addition to entering the annuity, I have zeroed out June 2001 strip in LT-SW deal # 573463.1 and added May strips in ST-WROCK deal # 576470.1.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
