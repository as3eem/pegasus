I will be out of town on Thursday.
I think that it would be great if you  could attend this info session on CommodityLogic - it would be good to hear  how this project is being described to a wider audience within Enron.
If you  can make it, please try to attend.
And I would love to have a voice mail  message afterwards with your feedback from the info session.
Thanks.
