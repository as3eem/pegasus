Market Participants:  There is one correction to the version mapping below.
April 4, 2001 should be Version 4 minus Version 1.
This was one day when we had an overwrite problem.
The version 1 for this day is what ties out to the original bill and supplemental invoice.
The supplemental invoice consisted of changes on 4/4, 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 through 4/30.
