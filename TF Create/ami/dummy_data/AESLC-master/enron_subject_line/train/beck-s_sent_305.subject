As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special  projects from time to time.
I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd  completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of  his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely  with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.
I don't know about the one  month timeframe.
I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and  determine the best way to proceed.
It might mean a couple of weeks over  there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.
I  don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly  without the family.
Can we still use Todd ?
