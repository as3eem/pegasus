Attached is the revised regulatory matrix for Transwestern's Red Rock Expansion project reflecting the request for an extension of time to replace the units at Station 4.
Remaining notifications include:  start of construction at Stations 1 & 3, and 4 if applicable (within 10 days),  end of construction and in-service date (within 10 days), actual costs (within 6 months after facilities constructed), noise survey at Stations 3 & 4 (within 60 days after in-service), and any additional changes in construction and/or mitigation procedures (WOULD REQUIRE A DIRECTOR'S LETTER BEFORE IMPLEMENTING CHANGE).
Questions -please let me know at 7138 in Omaha.
Thanks.
Donna
