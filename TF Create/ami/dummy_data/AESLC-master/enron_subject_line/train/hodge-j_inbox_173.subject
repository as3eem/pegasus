Mr. Hodge, At the recommendation of Eric Boyt, I forwarded you a copy of my resume last month in hopes of getting it passed on regarding a legal analyst position posted on the Enron web site.
I appreciate your efforts to forward it on to the people who posted the position.
I am writing to request that if you are aware of any other openings that could use a person with my skills set, I would greatly appreciate it if you could forward on my resume.
In case you lost the previous email, I will attach my resume to the bottom of this email.
Again, I want to thank you for all of your assistance.
