Howdy -  The early morning news on Channel 11 reported the arrest of someone the cops called "The Montrose Burglar".
They said he may be responsible for as many as ten armed robberies and is being charged with three, and that armed with a pistol, he would hold up people leaving bars and clubs late at night.
The mug shot showed a middle aged black guy, balding.
He doesn't sound like either the Fargo Carjacker or the Fairview Minivan Mugger but maybe, knock on wood, this arrest will put a liitle dent in the crime stats.
