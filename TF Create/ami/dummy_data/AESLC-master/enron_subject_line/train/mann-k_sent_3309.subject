Hi Pete,  I have a fire drill for you.
This contract needs to between Salmon Energy  LLC and GE, with no agency reference.
In other words, a CA Development  form.
Any chance of getting this today?
The delivery dates on one of the turbines will be changing, as is the payment  schedule.
Also, the designation of one of the turbines will change.
Salmon  will be receiving units 19, 20, 23 and 28 (a new one).
Thanks,
