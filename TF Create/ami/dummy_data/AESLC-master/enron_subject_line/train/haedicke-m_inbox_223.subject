Thank you to those who attended the Documentation Committee meeting in New York on November 29.
We look forward to meeting our European members at the meeting on December 13 in London.
Earlier this week, we distributed the first draft of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement with accompanying documents to the Committee.
We strongly encourage you to participate in the development of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement.
To that end, please send in your comments on the first draft of the Master Agreement by Monday, January 7.
Comments should be addressed to Kimberly Summe (ksumme@isda.org) and Katherine Darras (kdarras@isda.org).
