Dear Eric,  If you have last minute shopping to do, Omaha Steaks can still get  your gift there in time for Christmas!
But hurry, you must order by  9 a.m. (CST) Saturday, December 22nd and select Overnight Delivery to  ensure your package arrives before Christmas Day!
Since you'll need to select Overnight Shipping to ensure Christmas  Delivery, we are also taking an additional $24.00 discount off the  price of each of these e-mail specials!
If you don't need it there by  December 24th, you'll still save the extra $24.00!
Simply select your  shipping service when completing your order.
