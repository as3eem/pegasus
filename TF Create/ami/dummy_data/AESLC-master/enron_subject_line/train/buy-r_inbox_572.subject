Based on recent discussions with several energy firms, there appears to be interest in conducting a survey which *	summarizes the current state of risk management best practices within the industry, and *	provides benchmark data addressing current levels of risk based performance for various energy related lines of business  To respond to this interest, we would like to conduct a survey which addresses these goals.
We have prepared a proposal which outlines our approach for conducting a survey, and provides samples of expected output.
I will be in touch sometime next week to discuss the proposal with you, and determine your interest in participating.
I look forward to speaking with you, and potentially working with you as a participant in this project.
