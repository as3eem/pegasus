Hello All,  	We will begin our soccer season with the first practice  scheduled for this Wed (Aug 15) at 5:30 pm at the West U microsoccer  fields (adjacent to West U Elementary School).
This week we will  have one practice only.
Starting next week (Aug 20) there will be a  Monday practice with the West U trainers at 5:30 (same fields).
This  trainer practice is optional - however we found that the kids really  get a lot out of these trainer practices and they are probably better  for ball skills than what we will do in coaches practice.
We will  discuss other issues on Wed.
I'm looking forward to a fun season.
Thanks.
