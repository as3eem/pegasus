Gerald:  I just spoke with Shane Lakho again regarding the Tennessee Gas TPA.
She said that it may have been your predecessor, Sandy Brayband(?
), who was involved in this deal, but that the terms had been approved by ENA-Legal for ENA and ENA-Upstream.
Can you confirm this and let me know?
Thanks.
