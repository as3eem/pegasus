market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Market Participants,  The NYISO has determined that implementation of Virtual Trading will be delayed until Wednesday, November 7, 2001.
Issues associated with new computer hardware have necessitated extending the testing period to ensure that all systems are ready before starting the program.
Virtual Trading will be in place for the Wednesday, November 7 Day-Ahead Market (DAM).
The new schedule will permit bids for virtual load and virtual supply to be submitted for Wednesday's market after the DAM posts on Monday, November 5, until 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday, November 6.
