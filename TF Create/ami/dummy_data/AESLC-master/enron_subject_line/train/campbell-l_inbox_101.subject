DCongel@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Market Participants:  All advisory statements for 11/1999,12/1999, and 4/2001 have been posted to each customers web site.
08/2001 will be done this evening.
The NYISO was originally scheduled to invoice November 1999 and December 1999 on Friday 9/7/2001.
We have decided to delay this until next week to allow extra time verifying the data, and determining the correct version mapping for reconciling invoices.
April 2001, and August 2001 will be posted on 9/7/2001 as scheduled.
Payment dates associated with the November 1999 and December 1999 will be adjusted as necessary.
Market participants will be notified of any change when the invoices get posted.
