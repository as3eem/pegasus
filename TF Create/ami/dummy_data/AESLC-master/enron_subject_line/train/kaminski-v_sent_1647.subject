Vince  ***********************************************   rashed By Tax Selling                    But are there bargains among the discards?
By Michael Santoli                     Here it is more than six months since even the most  intransigent last-minute                   filers wrote checks to the IRS to render to the government  its due for their                   financial good fortune in 1999.
By rights, this should be a  season relatively                   free of concerns about taxes, notwithstanding the  presidential candidates'                   parrying over whose tax-cut math features more fuzz.
And yet, for anyone with a dollar in the stock market  (which in recent weeks                   has likely been reduced to loose change), the looming  demands of this year's                   levies on capital gains have helped to make this month yet  another taxing                   October for investors.
The jump-and-stumble course  the                                                  major stock indexes have  taken this                                                  year is being blamed for a                                                  particularly intense effort  among                                                  mutual-fund managers and  other big                                                  investors to sell their  losers.
The                                                  steep ramp-up in stocks that                                                  persisted from the fall of  1999                                                  through the first quarter of  this year
