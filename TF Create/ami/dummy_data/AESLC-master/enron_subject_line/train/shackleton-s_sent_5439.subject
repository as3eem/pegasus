Cheryl:  I just finished a conversation with Mara Alexander re:  Cargill-Alliant,  LLC.
She was inquiring whether we could add the weather rep (for the Trade  Option Exemption) to that amendment since it was not included in the Master  Agreement between ENA and Cargill, Incorporated.
I have not actually  reviewed that master but if she is right, we should not have a problem  complying with the request.
