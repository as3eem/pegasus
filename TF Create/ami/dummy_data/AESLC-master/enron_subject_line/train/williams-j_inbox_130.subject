Willy -   I having an electrician come out to install a new thermostat at your house.
He can do it sometime today or tomorrow.
I gave the electrician your work and home phone numbers so he will be calling you to see when he can go out.
We think the thermostat you got is a lemon.
We are just going to have a new one installed and see if it solves your problems.
