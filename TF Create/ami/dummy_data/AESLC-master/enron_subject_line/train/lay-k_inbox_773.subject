Dear Mr. Lay,  My name is Djoefree Hermanto and I am one of Enron shareholders.
I just like to mention that I really have full confident in you.
Even though, the current Enron situation financially impacts my family, but I fully believe any decision that you will make is definitely the best for everyone of us.
I'll support you and your team with prayers.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
