Dear Larry,  I'm Tom's fiance.
I know we didn't meet yet, but I need to ask you and Nancy a small favor.
I'm preparing a small book which I will give a copy to each person.
Tom doesn't know anything about that.
One part will be for Family and Friends.
So, what I need is some words that you want say to Tom or to the both of us on this special day.
If it is possivle for next weekend I will appreciate it.
Just send it by e-mail.
Thanks and best regards,
