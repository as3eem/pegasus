Hi Jeff,  I am a consultant working with Conoco (Downstream North America and Europe) - helping them reinvent their business through innovation.
My clients are Jim Nokes, EVP and Rick Hamm in Europe.
I would like to discuss with you the possibility of you speaking to a group of senior executives at Conoco UK, telling the Enron 'story' and how you've reinvented your business.
Your presence would be a very inspiring to them and telling the story 'live' would help them develop the mindset they need to innovate new products, services and get into new markets.
I will give you a call tomorrow (Tuesday) to follow up on your level of interest or I can be reached on my mobile at +1.617.306.0599 Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
