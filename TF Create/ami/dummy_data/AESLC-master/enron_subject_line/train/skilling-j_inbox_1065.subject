Dear Jeff,  Been a while.
Hope you are yours are doing OK after the tragedies in NY and DC.
Unfortunately, I lost a friend who was working at WTC.
Been a bit hard to get back to the normal aspects of life.
Will update you on some of the more relatively mundane but exciting developments on my end soon.
Currently just starting discussions for a potential CEO role at an enterprise software company.
Hope things go well for you.
Regards,

You OK?
