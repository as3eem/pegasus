Over the last couple of days, the virus pattern files that help to detect the latest viruses have been updated several times each day.
So, when you log in, the system will push the latest files and perform a scan.
This will continue as new viruses are detected and new pattern files created and distributed through our virus software providers.
Yesterday afternoon, we received the Computer Virus message regarding precautions when opening your email.
Additionally, to prevent Enron employees from accessing non-Enron mail from our network (and possibly introducing a mail-borne virus), we have blocked access to external email accounts (i.e., Hotmail, etc.
).
