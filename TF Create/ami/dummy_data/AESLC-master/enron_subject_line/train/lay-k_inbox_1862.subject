Dear Dr. Lay:  Today was Diwali, the festival of lights.
As I sat and prayed this evening my thoughts turned to you and I said a small prayer for all of my friends at Enron.
I have as you would expect been following the events of the last few weeks with concern.
I wish you all the strength and resolve as you commit yourself to leading Enron through these difficult times.
You have always been a leader to those who have worked closely with you and have surely faced more difficult times than these and successfully.
Best Wishes from all of us at THOT Capital,
