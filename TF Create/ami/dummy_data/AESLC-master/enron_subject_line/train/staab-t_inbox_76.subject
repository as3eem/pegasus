Hi Theresa,  We're under A TON of pressure this month to get our money in the door on time and as close to invoice amount as possible.
I want to make sure these people have absolutely no reason to pay us late.
As soon as you have the spreadsheet done, please email it to me so I can tie it to the system.
Thanks for your help!!
