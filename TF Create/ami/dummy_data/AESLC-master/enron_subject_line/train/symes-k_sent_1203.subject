582324 - Grays Harbor Paper Mill  582322 - Las Vegas Cogeneration  I've added the unit names to the deals and reminded Les that they need to be  in the comments section.
He was under the impression that the guideline sheet  he sent out re: unit names spelled out the answers, but I took another look  at it and it doesn't seem to really answer anything.
I've attached it just in  case you don't have it anymore - but please let me know if this assists you  guys in ANY way.
If it doesn't, I can probably get him to draw up something  more useful.
Thanks,
