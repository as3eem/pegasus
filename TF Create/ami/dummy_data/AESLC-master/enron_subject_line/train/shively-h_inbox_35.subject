I was looking at past levels, and I thouhgt to share my findings with you.
Highest levels as of the first week of April was in 1999 of 1,367 TCF.
Yesterday's AGA showed our levels @ 2,294.
In order to reach 1999's levels we ould need to withdraw about 103 BCF a week (2,294 less 1,367 divided vy the remaining 9 weeks until the first week of April).
Also, 1999 had the highest levels for the third week of January, levels were 2,039.
Year 2002 is 255 bcf ahead.
