John,   I went through the code and realized that the change to show months with 0 value is a little big change and cannot be done in hours.
The problem I see is that when portcalc values a post id, it does not create any data in database for the months where you do not have positions.
What it means it can be done but it will take minimum 3-4 days to make the changes, test it and give it to you.
Also it will slow down option grid a little more as I need to build rows with 0 values which are not in database.
I just wanted to give you an update and I will talk to Karima & Francis to let them know how we are going to handle it.
Let me know if you have any questions.
