With respect to he Bakersfield Californian on the list below, I am amending  my original approval for this counterparty to approve them to enter into  newsprint swaps and options only.
At this time our list does not reflect the  individual products you are trading.
I understand from Mark Taylor that he  spoke to Jeff Harbert last night about amending your excel spreadsheet to add  the individual pulp and paper financial products, since restrictions such as  this one will occur from time to time.
