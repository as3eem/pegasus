Pursuant to our conference call earlier today, I have attached draft TRO pleadings for the Jenks, Oklahoma project which can be included in your files.
These pleadings are simply a guide to what will be prepared for Arizona and Mississippi.
I will prepare a list of all current local counsel for the relevant projects and also include proposed local counsel for the Arizona and Mississippi projects.
At the moment, I am incorporating Mark's revisions to the statement of position and I will send them as soon as they have been included.
Please let me know if you need any further information.
