FYI.
Edison has been successful at peeling off one of the ESPs--New West.
Seems that in exchange for getting paid negative CTCs, New West may have agreed to take the position that all DA customers should be charged for Edison's undercollection.
I'm not aware of any other ESPs that are willing to take that position.
The salient quote in New West's "supplemental" PHC statement reads:
