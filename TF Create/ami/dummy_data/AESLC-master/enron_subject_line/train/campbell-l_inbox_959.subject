"Robb, Kathy" <KRobb@hunton.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Howard Fromer, chair of the ICAP Working Group, has asked that we cancel the ICAP Working Group meeting scheduled for next Tuesday, August 21, because it conflicts with the RTO mediation, which he and others involved in the ICAP Working Group are attending.
In addition, the Tuesday, September 11 meeting is cancelled and will be rescheduled for some time in September that does not conflict with the RTO effort.
If you have any questions, please contact John Charlton at the NYISO, Howard Fromer, or me.
Many thanks.
