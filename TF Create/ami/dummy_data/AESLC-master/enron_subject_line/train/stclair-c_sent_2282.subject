Ed: Rudwell and I would like to talk to you about the form of Trade Guaranty  Agreement that has been sent to us.
Specifically, we need some clarification  on how Section 5 works since some new language has been added to the June 1,  1999 form that we received.
Please call me at your convenience to discuss  this.
