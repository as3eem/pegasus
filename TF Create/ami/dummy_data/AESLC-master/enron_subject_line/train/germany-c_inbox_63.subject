Reminder we will be taking next week off and resume the following Tuesday, June 11.
Chris may be taking some time away from the study, but hopefully will come join us later in the summer.
If you know anyone who may be interested in coming, please invite them and let me know.
We will be starting "Practical Christian Living" study.
Try to memorize John 17:3.
Thx!
Bill
