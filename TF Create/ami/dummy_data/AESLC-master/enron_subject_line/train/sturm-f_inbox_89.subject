Indian Point 2 is expected to go into a midcycle outage starting this Friday (10/26/01).
We anticipate they will be down for about two weeks.
We will keep you updated as they are getting a lot of heat from the NRC and have a lot of pressure of the former Con Edison employees to perform, that are now working for Entergy.
