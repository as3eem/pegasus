FYI.
This close date is of large significance to GPG as we are going to be  asking management to wait an extra week for monthly info that ties out to the  financials.
This variance from what we thought was a "Common Design" is a  huge deal, in fact the agreed upon close timing was a major consideration in  getting agreement within GPG to go forward as it was an improvement that we  could see had value.
I agreed to and "stacked hands" with all on the  "Common Design", yet somehow there has been a failure to deliver the "Common  Design".
I just want to make sure that the two of you are aware of my  position on this issue.
