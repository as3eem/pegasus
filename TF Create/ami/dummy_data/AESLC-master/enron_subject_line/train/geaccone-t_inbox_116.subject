FYI,  Please take note of the date change.
The next Outage Coordination Commercial Review meeting is 09/13/01.
The purpose for the meeting is to discuss outages that have a flow impact with the Commercial groups.
I will send out an outage report prior to the meeting.
If you have any questions or concerns, please give me a call.
