Sally,  I am currently working with Cindy Olson and Kelly Kimberly in the diversity area, of which Ken Lay has asked to put renewed emphasis on.
Mr. Lay participates in the Houston CEO Diversity Roundtable, which consist of 10 of Houston's largest corporations.
On October 16th Cindy, Kelly and I met with Gerald Smith of Smith Graham & Company, Robert Carter of The Enterprise Group and Willie Alexander of W.J.
Alexander & Associates as a follow-up to a recent meeting Mr. Lay and Cindy attended.
These gentlemen represent a coalition of 13 Houston relatively large minority professional services firms who are looking to bring additional value to Enron and expand their footprint in some of the larger Houston area companies.
According to Cindy, the goal is for Enron to be a pilot in utilizing some of these professional services firms.
My plan is to conduct due diligence on these organzations prior to making formal recommendations to the Management Committee.
