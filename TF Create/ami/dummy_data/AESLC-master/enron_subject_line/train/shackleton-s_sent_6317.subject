Mary:  Attached is the latest draft from Chase.
In particular, please take a look at the following paragraphs:  2.A (the definition of "Securities") 5.B (lien on securities) 5.C (setoff)  The ENA contact is Gennaro Contella.
Please leave me or Sheila a voice mail  and we can arrange a conference call on Monday with Gennaro, Nancy Callahan,  if necessary (Chase legal) and anyone that you need to conference in on  behalf of Enron Corp.
The traders are anxious to have this account in place.
Irrespective of which Enron entity takes ownership of this agreement, we were  looking to you for information regarding existing Chase accounts (in ENA's  name).
Thanks for your help.
