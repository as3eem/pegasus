The latest word is that the work surrounding the restructuring activity will not take place until this Thursday.
Therefore, I have moved the Training for this effort to tomorrow (Wednesday) from 2 pm - 3:30 pm in ECS 04990.
I will send another email to all of your managers who will need to attend, but please let them know it will not be held today.
