We have previously told the TX PUC Staff we will be posting required collateral of $100,000 by the end of the month  (as required by Rule 25.107(f)) in order to maintain EES certification.
The requirement is that we maintain "unused cash resources of at least $100,000, which will allow the REP to incur in Texas up to $250,000 in total monthly billings from TDUs."
Staff says we can meet this requirement by posting the $$ to an account of our choice.
We just need to notify them where the money is and state the money is for the purpose of this rule.
