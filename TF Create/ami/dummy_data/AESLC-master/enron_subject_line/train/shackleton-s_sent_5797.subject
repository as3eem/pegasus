Audrea:  Per my voice mail of date, please feel free to contact me aboutthe 2/1/01 gas  floor.
As I mentioned in my voice mail, the ISDA Commodity Derivatives  Definitions provide for the Floating Amount language for caps and floors (see  Section 6.2).
"Exercise" language is not necessary as this is addressed in  the referenced definitions.
