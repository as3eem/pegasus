Jeff:  I have a copy of an "equity swap" between ENE and JEDI SPV I, LLC dated April  20, 2000 which wants to be a "forward", and which terminates on Sept. 11,  2000.
The transaction is for 12,012,804 shares and a Notional USD  852,909,084.
Can you send me a copy of the JEDI LP "forward" which appears on Jill's  list?
Is it meant to be the confirm above?
Sara
