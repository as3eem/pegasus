Suzanne: FYI.
Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?
I may be able to  help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there.
Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked  or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.
If  the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would  prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to  worry about it.
Let me know what you think.
Sorry to impose but I tried to  do as much as I could before I left.
