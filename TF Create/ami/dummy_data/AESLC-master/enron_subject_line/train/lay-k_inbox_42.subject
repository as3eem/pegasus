Ken, Beau and I would like to share the family partnership and investment information with Bernstein to get their Family Wealth group up to speed.
We think they can provide a perspective on diversification and they will do it at no cost and without an established relationship, unlike most of the investment banks.
Painewebber needs your permission to release the information.
Would you please send Rocky a letter authorizing Beau or me to release this information to third parties so we can move forward?
Thanks, Mark
