Paul was too nervous using the local firm of Tindall & Foster.
Kevin Zemp  was recommended by our Calgary office.
Kevin refined the prior information  and will "pre-clear" Paul with authorities for Paul's trip entering through  Calgary around 8/24/99.
Do you have any comments to the new attachment?
