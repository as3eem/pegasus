Hi Sally,  I know it's very early to be contacting you, but I hope that you will remember KPMG when you get to UBS and need help with systems integration/data mapping type work.
UBS was one of my clients when I lived in Switzerland and I was very involved with the implementation of a system called DACFA 2 which was used for global data pooling and consolidation.
I have actually re-initiated contact with people I know in UBS Corporate Audit in Zurich and will be providing them with general information concerning wholesale energy trading.
We would very much like to speak to you regarding your planned role in Netco and the direction you think the company will take.
Again, I realize that's it very early, but I know that you will continue to operate at Enron speed and if we wait it will be too late to help.....  Best regards,
