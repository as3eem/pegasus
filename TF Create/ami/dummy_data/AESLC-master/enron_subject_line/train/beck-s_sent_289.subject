Please print the attachment for me in color ( I have to put that burnt orange  on my bulletin board), put this event on my calendar and research flight  information for me.
I would fly over on the afternoon of the 7th and back on  the morning of the 8th.
Check with Karen to see if she is handling hotel  reservations, or if we should make those.
Thanks.
