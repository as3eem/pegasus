Wendy -- As discussed.
MidAm is anxious to get this EEI in place, and you had indicated the open power trades are not a large exposure (SeeAtttachement A below).
Enron's triangular set-off is installed in 5.6, not the EEI's square set-off in the 5.6 B election.
Please help assure that execution of this fits into the larger credit picture as well.
