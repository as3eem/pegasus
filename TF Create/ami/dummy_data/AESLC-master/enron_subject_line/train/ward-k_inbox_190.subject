Kim,  Sorry that I have not called in a while.
I have been busy and with all the distractions at Enron, I did not want to bother you.
I hope you are coping through the mess and hope that you also had a good Xmas and New Year.
I am in Houston next week (arriving the 7th) and would like to see you.
If you are available, I'd be happy to buy lunch or dinner.
Please let me know.
Take care,  Laird
