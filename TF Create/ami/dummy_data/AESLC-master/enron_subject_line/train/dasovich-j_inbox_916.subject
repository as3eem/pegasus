Hi Jeff:  I'm not sure if hiring is an issue these days for you, but I wanted to let you know that Jim Bushnell and I will be again teaching a course at Berkeley this spring called "Energy Market Strategies and Policies."
The course is cross-listed between the Haas School of Business and the Energy & Resources Group (ERG) at UC Berkeley.
The course is currently limited to 42 students, but it is already over-subscribed, so we are trying to move it to a larger classroom.
We'll have mostly MBA students from Haas, but also about a dozen masters students from ERG.
There are also usually at least a few PhD students.
The students in the class are were very smart -- many of them
