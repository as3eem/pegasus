Friends,   I'll be in D.C.
THIS MONDAY afternoon and evening (Sept. 24th) and am scheduled to meet briefly with Tom White and Judy Smith at the Pentagon between 2:30 and 3:30.
I know many of you have been in contact with them since they left, and especially during the last several, tragic days.
But if anyone would like to send them an "Encouraging/We Care About You" (or even "God's Speed/Go Get'em")- kind- of eMail, please address the note(s) to Tom and /or Judy and eMail it to me: christie_patrick@enron.com <mailto:christie_patrick@enron.comsend>--I'll print them and hand deliver them on Monday....I KNOW they'd BOTH love this!!!!
I'll check my eMails through Sunday night at 11:30pm.
