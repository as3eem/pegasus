Ken, we are working with a team that is building ethanol plants throughout the Southeast and the Midwest, and we are in the process of arranging the right capital partner as well as identifying the right strategic partner for that endeavor.
The other players in this ambitious project have relationships into Enron, but I thought that you might be able to shove me in the right direction of the person to talk to there.
I hope all is well with you, and one day when you are in the DC area and have nothing better to do you will let me have the opportunity to visit over dinner and reflect on how many years it has been since you and we created the Natural Gas Clearing House.
We are having a lot of fun putting together large private equity deals and you might find that aspect of what we do as possibly interesting as well.
We have expanded into the energy and utilities space as telecomm and technology have had their share of problems.
In any event, would appreciate the input and look forward to a visit in the not too distant future.
Best regards, Tom
