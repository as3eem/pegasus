Heather,   Could we handle the CRRA LOI at the same time?
It would help me get finished  with the FCE doc.
I'm sure you saw that GE and Honeywell are merging.
I wonder if that makes  ONSI a part of GE?
Does GE have a fuel cell product yet?
It would explain  the statement in the Journal that headquarters would not be in NJ or  Connecticut.
