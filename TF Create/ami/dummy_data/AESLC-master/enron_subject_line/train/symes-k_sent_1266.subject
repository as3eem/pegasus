Here's the latest info.
regarding Bloomberg's ability to accept deals with  Pinnacle West (formerly Arizona Public Service Co.).
From now on, we'll enter  ALL deals with Pinnacle, despite Bloomberg's slow response to the  counterparty name change.
If you never knew that Bloomberg wasn't accepting  confirms with the name Pinnacle on them, then disregard this message and  continue as you were.
Thanks,
