All, 	 We had a piece computer equipment that has gone missing.
The device is a network hub that looks like the attached picture.
It was hooked up to 3 computers over in the area of HR last night about 4:00 pm and was noticed to be missing about 6:00 am this morning.
If anybody know where it may have gone please let HR or myself know as soon as possible.
Regards
