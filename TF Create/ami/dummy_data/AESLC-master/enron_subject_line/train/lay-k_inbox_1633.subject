...bring in a respected CEO from OUTSIDE the company.
Do  SOMETHING.
All you need is one or two days of positive news  (something...
ANYTHING) to stop the freefall and get analysts to reassess the  stock and see it for the bargain it is.
But then again, why listen to me.
If I was so smart I WOULDN'T STILL  BE HOLDING THE ENRON STOCK I BOUGHT IN AUGUST.
Sincerely, A Shareholder
