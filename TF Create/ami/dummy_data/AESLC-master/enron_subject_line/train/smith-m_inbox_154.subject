Dear Matthew,  HB 1877, by Rep. Patricia Gray, has been set on the House of Representatives Calendar for debate TODAY, Wednesday, May 09, 2001.
This bill would protect your right to choose where you purchase your contact lenses by providing for automatic release of contact lens prescriptions upon final fitting and allowing for a faxed copy of your prescription, instead of requiring a hand written original.
Legislators need to hear from contact lens wearers in support of this important bill IMMEDIATELY.
Please call your state representative's office now and let them know: 1) You are a constituent of their district.
2) You would like them to vote for HB 1877.
3) You support automatic release of contact lens prescriptions, and a faxed copy instead of an original handwritten one because it protects your right to choose where you buy your contact lenses.
