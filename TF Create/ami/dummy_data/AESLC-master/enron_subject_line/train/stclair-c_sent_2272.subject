Pam: I saw Janet Greene last week and she said that she was working with you.
She  looked great!
Can we get together for lunch sometime soon?
Let me know some  dates that work for you in the next 1-2 weeks.
I'm in the office Tuesday  through Thursday.
Everything is going well.
Charles is on the verge of walking!
I'm now in  the power trading group and loving the work.
Hope to hear from you soon.
