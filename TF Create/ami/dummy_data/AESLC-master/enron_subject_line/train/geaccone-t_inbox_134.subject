You are scheduled to attend the 2nd Annual Global Accounting Leadership Offsite Thursday and Friday, September 20 and 21, in Galveston, Texas.
Rick Causey has reserved one hour of this conference for an "Open Forum," at which we plan to discuss whatever you, the Global Accounting Leadership, wish to discuss.
In order to get an idea of what the topics of interest are, as well as to do any preliminary fact-finding which may be possible, please reply to this eMail and submit the topic(s) you would like to see discussed.
I will compile the list and forward to Rick without names associated.
If for any reason you are concerned about anonymity, you may also send a note via interoffice mail (EB 1769) or other confidential means.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks!
