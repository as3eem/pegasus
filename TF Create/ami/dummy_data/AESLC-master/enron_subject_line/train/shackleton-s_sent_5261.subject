Earlier this year, I negotiated this agreement with GS&C.
I cannot locate  the agreement so GS&C is sending a copy.
The Enron party is ENA.
We now  need to amend the authorized trader list which I will email to you.
ENA's  use of GS&C's platform is for trading US treasuries, agencies, money market,  corporates, JGB's.
We need to:  (1)  remove Harry Arora (who was the sole authorized trader)  (2)  add the following:       Darren Delage    Shane Dallmann    Ellen Su    Pushkar Shahi    Gary Hickerson  THIS IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR GARY AND WE SHOULD TRY TO COMPLETE TODAY.
