Dear Mr. Kaminski,  I was referred to you by Dr. Shi-Jie Deng of the Georgia Tech School of ISyE.
He suggested I send my resume to you because of my interest in the Energy Industry.
I will be receiving my master's degree in Quantitative and Computational Finance from Georgia Tech in December 2001.
My academic background also includes a strong emphasis on research, Mathematics, and Physics.
