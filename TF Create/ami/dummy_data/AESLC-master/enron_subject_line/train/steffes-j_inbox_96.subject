Attached is our updated forecast.
Note that for Monday the largest proposed distribution is for California Gas through the end of the month.
That decision is currently being evaluated by the business with a final decision on Monday.
A minimum of $250,000 for Ca.
gas will be required.
Please have the cash committee approve the entire balance of the month contingent on business sign-off.
Thanks
