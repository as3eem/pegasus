With all of the events of yesterday, information for the DPR for the above dates is not yet complete.
At the present time, we are planning to issue a final DPR for the 30th of November as well as a preliminary and then final for the 3rd of December.
However, we do not yet have an estimated time for these to be issued.
I will keep you up to date when I have additional information.
If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 9123.
Best regards
