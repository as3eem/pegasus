Norma,  It seems that there is a bug in the system.
I made an error  mixing equity and merit raises in one column.
The system does not allow me to correct the  mistake by moving the entries from one column to another.
I can enter the changes, but after I save them the system  reverts to original  designations.
As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity  raises.
The column totals are misleading.

Merit increases
