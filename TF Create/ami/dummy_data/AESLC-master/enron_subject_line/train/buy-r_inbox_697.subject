Shona,   As per my memo to you on August 13th, I am scheduling a kick-off meeting with individuals to discuss a daily tie-out process across all global risk applications/reports, i.e.
DPR, Infinity, RisktRAC (VAR and Benchmark) and CAS.
This would provide proof (or a trail to what is missing)  that required information from all risk books, commodities, and business units are appropriately reported on a daily basis.
As stated earlier, without a robust global books application, the daily process currently in place provides little assurance that "everything" rolls up correctly.
It also does not include Infinity.
My suggestion for attendance at this meeting, in addition to you, Beth and I, is as follows:  	Stacey White 	Todd Hall 	Sheila Glover/Clara Carrington
