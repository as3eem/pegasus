Am I begging too much?
Can you mail her package tomorrow?
I meant to ask today, but I got home so  late I didn't get things together.
I put one of Michael's airplane pictures  in there.
If all else fails we can take Michael to Fort Worth.
My mom would love to  watch him as she wants him to be exposed to Fort Worth culture.
(a better  grade of  bean dip).
I'm very excited!!!!
Love,
