Caroline:  I am in the midst of preparing these annexes now.
You should take special note of the credit that Paul is insisting upon (seems  to be similar to AIG).
This is all credit - but note his Additional  Termination Event if the ISDA is not executed within 60 days.
You must  discuss all of the items with your counterparty.
Also, if you do the deal(s), give me the name, phone/fax numbers, email  addresses of all commercial and legal for your counterparties.
