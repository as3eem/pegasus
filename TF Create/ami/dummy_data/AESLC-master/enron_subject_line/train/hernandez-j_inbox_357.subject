I was denied access to the "nyiso price information version 2", and therefore was unable to add the NY prices to the shiftnote.
I received an error message stating, "Cannot access read-only document 'NYISO Price Information version 2.xls'.
Perhaps each individual on the 24-hour desk will require clearance from IT.
