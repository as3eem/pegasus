Due to the release of schedule C for ENA and EES, the attached spreadsheet provides the trading p&l without prudency and the associated Daily Loss Limit notifications.
Additionally, the spreadsheet reflects the net effect on the Total Trading line.
If the Corp. Var remains at $100mm, then a Daily Loss Limit notification would be sent out.
However, the current opinion is that the Corp. Var is $150mm, including discretionary Var, which eliminates the notification.
Please let me know if you have any quetions.
Thanks,
