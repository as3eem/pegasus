Tana,  In trying to complete my assignment on the NETCO Adoption Agreements, I have found that 11 Gas, 6 Power and 6 Financial Adoption Agreements remain outstanding.
Before "bothering" the people assigned to complete the Adoption Agreements, I would appreciate your checking your records to determine the following:  1.
Was the particular Master noted on the attached spreadsheet in fact identified and/or found and given to someone?
2.
If the Master was identified/found, was it reassigned to another person than that named on the attached spreadsheet.
Thanks for your help in getting this all figured out.
Steve
