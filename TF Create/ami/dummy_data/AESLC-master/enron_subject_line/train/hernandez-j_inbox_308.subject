Juan,  How are you?
I ran into Jaime Bustos last week and your name came up.
How's the family?
Any more kids?
We're doing well in Louisville.
You may already know this, but Sterling and I started a company a few years ago that provides information to the energy markets on plant output.
Pretty interesting stuff.
