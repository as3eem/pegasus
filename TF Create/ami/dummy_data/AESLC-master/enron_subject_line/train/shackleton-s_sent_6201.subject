Jay:  We sent this master for execution on May 1, 2001 and the counterparty just  responded to John with some comments.
Only one comment is credit related:   LPC does not want to pay default interest as per the ISDA agreement.
LPC  does not want interest compounded daily.
What is your position?
I have made all other changes or given LPC an explanation.
