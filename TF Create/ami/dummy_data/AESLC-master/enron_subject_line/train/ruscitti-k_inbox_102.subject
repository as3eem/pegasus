Classmates,  The reunion is rapidly approaching!
I think we have been able to get ahold of just about everyone now, and it looks like there will be a very big turn-out ... thanks for taking the time to let us know your plans!!
Also, special thanks to Constantine for doing a bang-up job on recruiting,
