I am trying to set this thing up to go in front of the Cash Committee on Monday.
I assume this is your final review.....Joe is cool with what I forwarded him.
After your final changes, I'll forward to Chip, Rich and Doug Sewell...and let them know Monday is the day.
Thanks.
You are a big help and I really admire your skill set....seriously, I do.
I want to be like you when I grow up.
