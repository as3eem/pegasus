The following item was presented in this week's corporate change control....  Dec. 28 Beginning at 5:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will remove domain controllers CORPHOU-DCARD02 and CORPHOU-DCARD03 from service to be rebuilt.
These are just two of the numerous active domain controllers within the Corp domain.
There should be no disruption of service as user requests should automatically be redirected to an active domain controller.
Once these servers are rebuilt, they will be returned to the Corp domain.
Dec. 31 From 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will move ECTHOU-HR1 to the Ardmore data center.
This move will result in a total disruption of service for those HR users whose S:\ drive is mapped to this server.
