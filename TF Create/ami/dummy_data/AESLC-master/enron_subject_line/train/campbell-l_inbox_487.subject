market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Market Participants  1st Rochdale Cooperative.
Ltd. is being removed from the NYISO-administered electric energy markets.
The changeover of 1st Rochdale's customers to the provider of last resort, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, will take place on Friday, October 12 for the Saturday, October 13th market.
1st Rochdale had previously posted a sufficient amount of collateral to cover its obligations to the energy market and the NYISO anticipates, therefore, that no losses associated with this transition will be borne by the market.
Regards,
