I noticed from the attached report that the ExxonMobile case is set for tri= al=20 on June 25th.
Since I have not heard from Jim Armogida or you about the cas= e,=20 I have assumed that you have it covered and that Corp has determined that t= he=20 potential liability lies at the Corp level.
If this assumption is wrong,=20 please let me know asap.
