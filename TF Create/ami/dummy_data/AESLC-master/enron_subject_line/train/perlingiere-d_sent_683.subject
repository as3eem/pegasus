Stacy,  Currently I have pending on my desk a GISB from you however, ENA's special  provisions are not included.
Also, a draft of a Master agreement was sent to  Markwest this summer.
Can you give me an update on the status of the  purposed draft?
With regards to the GISB, we can discuss ENA's special  provisions at your convenience.
Please let me have your thoughts.
Best regards,
