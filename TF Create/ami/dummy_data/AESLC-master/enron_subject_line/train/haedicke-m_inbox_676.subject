I am faxing to each of you a copy of a letter dated November 8, 2001 that I received today from Ms. Plitsch regarding the Hong Kong litigation that I believe Matt managed.
Mark Haedicke had a received a copy from Mark Frevert.
I believe that both of you have knowledge of this matter.
Of course, this is written from Ms. Plitsch's point of view.
Please review and indicate what you would recommend as a course of action to reply to her letter.
Regards, Alan
