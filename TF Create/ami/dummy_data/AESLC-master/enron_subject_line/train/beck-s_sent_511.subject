I do know Susan so I could probably approve this request.
However, in my  staff meeting on Monday ( I know that Katherine was there, and not you), one  of the major points that I made centered around my approval of requests for  EOL access.
We can discuss when we get together on Friday morning.
Susan  needs to put her managers name at the bottom of this form, and the manager  should  okay this as well.
