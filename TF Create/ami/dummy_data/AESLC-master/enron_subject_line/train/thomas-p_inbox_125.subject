Hi Paul, Finally drug your file out to the basement.
I have attached several different options in the Excel file below.
Keep in mind that about 5 weeks after closing you will receive a check from your current lender for the existing escrow account.
You can either pocket that money or "reimburse" your out put from this closing.
Let me know if you need further clarification on this or any of the options.
I've attached the application and forms I need for processing.
I have survey, dec page and mortgage info already mostly need updated W2, paystubs and banking info.
