Sharon,  I have the confirmations on my desk for the deals that you requested, with  the exception of two deals.
Deal N60753.4 and N60753.6 were booked to change  an existing deal (N60753.3) from a financial swap to a physical forward.
We  will have the paperwork on those two deals after lunch -- we're getting them
