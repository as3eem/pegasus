Just wanted to check in.
I just talked with Tim, and he seemed to be holding up ok, in spite of it all.
I hope that you guys are able to salvage something out of all this.
Keep me posted.
Not sure what's next for you, but I'd be happy to talk with you about career options whenever is convenient.
I'll be in NY next week and the week after, and would be happy to catch up then.
My mom's phone number is 631 549 9254.
Talk to you soon!
Jon
