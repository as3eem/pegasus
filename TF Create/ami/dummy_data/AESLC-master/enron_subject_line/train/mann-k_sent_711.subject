Ben,  We have a draft of the VEPCO "standard" interconnect, which has been  internally reviewed by Mitch Robinson and Christi Nicolay.
Would you like a  copy?
Nancy Wodka (Bracewell & Patterson, DC office) is outside counsel  working on it as well.
We have had no substantive discussions with VEPCO  about this agreement at all.
Let me know how you want to proceed.
Thanks,
