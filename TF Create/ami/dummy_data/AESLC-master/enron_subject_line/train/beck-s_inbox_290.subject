Sally,  Attached is the updated of the headcount file I sent you on Friday.
I misunderstood the original request and provided December 31 plan for all four years.
I have now updated the file with December 31 actual headcount numbers for 1998 through 2000 and plan for 2001.
I have also updated the EGM numbers and inserted a summary tab.
If you have any questions, let me know.
Thanks,
