I've mentioned to all teams that I will be leaving early today.
I am going to do an end of day for UPS shipments if there are any that need to be canceled please leave at my work area also if you have any UPS additions you will need to fill out a Package & Ship request form, located at my desk along with UPS envelops.
If you should need any assistance please let Sharon Brown know.
Thanks,
