Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:  We do not anticipate FERC approval of the second tie-in until later today, so WIC is revising the schedule for contract in service as set forth below.
We will notify you if there are any further delays.
Judy Warhover will be sending a replacement page reflecting the revised dates early next week.
Please call with any questions or concerns.
