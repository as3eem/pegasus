Please review and comment on the attached draft statement of  organization for the EEI contract working group.
Once the statement is  agreed to by the drafting committee, I suggest we present it at the next meeting  of the Working Group.
Given the press of time, I would suggest holding  that meeting at EEI the week of October 22.
I would propose  holding the next meeting of the Drafting Committee in early January around the  15th.
