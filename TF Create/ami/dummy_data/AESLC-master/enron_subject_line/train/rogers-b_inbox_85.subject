see you over friday around 5:30p.m.
for pizza and  beers.
I think i forgot to put you guys on the list, at least two enron guys  will be there - Tom Kalb and Dan Castagnola, other than that it will be Capstone  people, my immediate neighbors, and may an el paso person or two, and one  Intergen friend.
see you there, let me know if you cannot come so i can plan out  how much pizza to order, thanx.
Wives and kids are  ok.
