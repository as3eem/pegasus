Mark  Attached is the preliminary outline of a conference EEI is considering  holding on November 17, 1999 to introduce the form of standardized power  contract developed through EEI.
You will note that EEI listed you as a  potential speaker.
EEI has also called me to discuss my role in this  presentation but I wanted to get your thoughts first.
Thanks
