As you know, our mid-year performance review process is under way.
In order for this process to be successful, you must select at least five reviewers who can best speak about your performance.
The PEP system closes on May 25, 2001 and all feedback must be completed at this time.
Please promptly select your reviewers so that they will have ample opportunities to provide feedback.
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at extension 57809.
Thanks,
