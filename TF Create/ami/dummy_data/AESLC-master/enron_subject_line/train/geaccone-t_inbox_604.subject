Hi Tracy,  I've been thinking of you since Enron's in the news all the time now.
I bet it is stressful around there now.
How are you doing?
How was your Thanksgiving?
We were in Houston last weekend after Thanksgiving & took my parents to Galveston for the weekend.
Dylan got his first ear infection so I wasn't able to see anyone but Stephanie.
Email me back.
Bye, Dana
