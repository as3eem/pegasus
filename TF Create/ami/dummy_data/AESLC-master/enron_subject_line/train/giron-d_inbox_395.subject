Jim @ Kaztex bought 20/d NBPL @ Harper on our behalf from Tenaska.
Jim sold it to us at his cost, he said--$1.84.
Said yesterday's deal was at 2 cents over his cost, but that you had done him a favor and that he also owed us one related to something Patrice had done for him, so that 'we're even' now.
