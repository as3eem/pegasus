Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:  We received notification that the 5th segment to gate valve 6 providing a total firm capacity of 495 Mdth/day was approved by FERC today.
Based on the feedback some of you have provided today, and since this is late notice on a Friday afternoon, the contracts will be effective on Monday, October 29, but the capacity will be available tomorrow and Sunday.
We filed the 6th segment to gate valve 5 this past Tuesday (October 23) and are prepared to file the final segment as soon as one currently being reviewed is approved.
Please call me if you have any questions.
