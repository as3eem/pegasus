Someone was asking me the other day if I had any friends at Enron....you came to mind!
Are you weathering the storm?
Unbelievable is the word that comes to my mind.
We use Andersen also and I know they are quite "tight lipped" about the situation!
I sincerely hope everything works out for you and the other Enron employees that have done nothing more than "bust your rears" for the good of the "Big E".
Stay in touch,  Alton D. Heckaman, Jr.
Swift Energy Company Senior Vice President Chief Financial Officer
