Gentlemen,  I have created a new file to track our physical P&L and power flows.
I have tried to simplify the data entry, by coloring only the cells that require an input.
If the cell is white than it is a formula and no data entry is required.
Also, the file now accurately captures reservation charges, and flowed vs.  reserved megawatts.
I created 2 copies of the file.
One for Peter, Joe, and Willis.
And the other for the night crew.
