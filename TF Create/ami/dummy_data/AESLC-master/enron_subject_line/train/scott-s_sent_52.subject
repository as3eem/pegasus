The attached document shows my proposed changes to Universal's agreement in  redlining.
I tried not to over-lawyer or make this overly complicated, but  in my view this needed a lot of basic cleanup.
Many of my changes are simply  to make the language more accurate (for example, in the use of defined  terms).
In a couple of places, I have questions:  1) In the second opening paragraph,  I don't know whether it is possible to attach the Proposal as an exhibit; if  not, ignore my change.
2) Section 4.a.
-- their provision for an adjustment
