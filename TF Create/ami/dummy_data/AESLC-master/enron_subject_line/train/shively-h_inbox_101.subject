Hunter,  Below you will find attached the breakout of our sales between affiliated and third party markets.
I looked at one sample day, so the volumes listed under daily marketed volumes may switch between affiliated and third party on a daily basis.
These volumes will also fluctuate depending upon production.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
