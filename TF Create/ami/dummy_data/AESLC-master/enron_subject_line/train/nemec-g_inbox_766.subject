Louis DiCarlo called and needed the binder back on the Pluto contracts.
He said you had given them your opinion so he thought you were through with them.
He needed them returned and so I gave them to him.
There was a memo sitting on top of the binder but I did not give it to him.
It is still on your bookcase.
Hope it was okay.
