Recently, EnronOnline has changed direction in regards to 3rd party access to EnronOnline and our technology.
We want to make sure that we are working closely with each of your desks to ensure that both of our interests are aligned.
Please be informed of two initiatives that we are working on.
Creating private label e-market places for other companies  	- We are utilizing the technology that we've created for EnronOnline to create similar platforms for other companies (real time trading to inventory management).
