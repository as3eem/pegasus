Hi Richard,       I am writing to let you know (if you have not heard already) that over twenty-five former Regional Directors of the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP) have formed a new international nonprofit association of risk managers.
The new association, called the Professional Risk Managers' International Association (PRMIA, pronounced as "premia"), will include local chapters in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, North America and South America.
If you would like to know more about the new organisation and how to join please email me and I will be happy to give you more details.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Regards
