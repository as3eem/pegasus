A outside source suggested to me that I, as a stockholder, should E-Mail my senator and request the government's help to bail out Enron.
After all they bailed out Chrysler, the airlines, and many other companies and are helping Afghan.
Enron was the  7th largest company in the US.
The government should help  Enron while we restructure.
Can Enron E-Mail all employees and stockholders and request  they E-Mail their Senator &/or Congressman and suggest the above.
