OKay, so I thought the weather might get better but it's looking as if Sunday and Monday may be the only nice weather we will have, if at all.
so, let's plan on that day/night/day combo for boating activities.
If that weater starts to change for the worst, do we want to postpone for another sunnier weekend and/or just take the festivities somewhere indoors??
love, k
