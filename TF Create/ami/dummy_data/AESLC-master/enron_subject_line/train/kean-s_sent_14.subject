We can create significant mutual benefit by partnering with a firm which is  focussed on developing IT systems for bulk power systems:   We need to take our deregulation model to the next level of detail by having  IT solutions which will support our view of how the market ought to work.
The IT firm would benefit from our access to the policy makers (domestic and  international)  whose decisions will make the IT firm's systems either  successful or obsolete.
Call me if you would like to discuss.
