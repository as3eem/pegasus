We'll be paying APS for line losses 7/11 at HE 7.
I've entered two deals to cover this - a buy from El Paso (Deal #679653) and a sale to Arizona (Deal #679693).
PLEASE ENTER A PRICE INTO THE BUY FROM EL PASO - 679653 - AND NOTE THAT PRICE IN THE EL PASO MODEL.
LAST TIME WE PAID BACK LINE LOSSES THIS DID NOT HAPPEN.
Let me know if you have questions.
Thanks,
