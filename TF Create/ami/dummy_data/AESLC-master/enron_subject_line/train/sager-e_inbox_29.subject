Would both of you mind taking a look at this first thing Monday and, if possible, give me your comments by COB.
(So sorry for the crunch!)
I need to send something to Mike by Monday evening for distribution Tuesday for Thursday's meeting.
Shari - I know this is a little more detailed than the one you sent out to potential supporters, but we can resend it telling them that we added several items at the request of some of the other potential supporters.
If you feel strongly about not including some of this, lets talk.
Elizabeth - you too - if I included stuff that might be a "turn off" - or failed to include critical components, please let me know.
Thanks.
