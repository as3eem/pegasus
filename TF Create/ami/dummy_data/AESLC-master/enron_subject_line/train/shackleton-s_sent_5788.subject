Hi, Steve:  We am preparing a form of assignment from ECT Investments, Inc. in favor of  Enron North America Corp. whch will transfer several credit derivative  Transactions.
I anticipate an attachment to the assignment which will  identify the trades.
I believe that Bill Bradford (Ernon) and Mark  Tarkington have discussed these trades and Bill is sending me the list.
Please let me know that you are aware of this request.
Thanks.
