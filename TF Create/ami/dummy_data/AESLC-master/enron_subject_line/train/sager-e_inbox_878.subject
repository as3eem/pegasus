Elizabeth,  As a follow-up to our discusion on Monday and my voice-mail this morning, and the two voice-mails I have left for Marcus today, I thought I would try this method of communication as well.
I'd like to wrap up the EEI Agreement between us as soon as possible, and would be grateful if either you or Marcus would give me a call.
I understand that you must still be very busy, but I hope that either you or Marcus will find the time to give me a call.
Thanks,
