I have taken the email that Connie and Trish forwarded to us and broken it down into direct questions.
Dave Odle will be preparing the hig level comparison of Version 1.3 to Version 1.4.

If you have time to respond to these items (by company) by 3:00 p.m., tomorrow,  I will try to consolidate and have them prepared for display and discussion.
Thanks.
