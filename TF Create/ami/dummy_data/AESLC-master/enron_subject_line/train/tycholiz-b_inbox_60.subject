Barry,  Could you go through the attached list and identify which of your customers in column B correspond to the names in column D?
There may be no match in column D.  If so, please indicate as such.
This is part of the project with structuring and credit to identify which of our customers have master firm and master swap agreements in place.
Credit has a number of different subsidiaries in its database, and these subsidiaries do not necessarily correspond to the customer names in our own database.
Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions.
Phil
