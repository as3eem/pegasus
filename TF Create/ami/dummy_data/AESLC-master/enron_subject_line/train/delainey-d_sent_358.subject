Guys, we appreciate your efforts on this project but we will not be needing  your services as owners engineer on the Vitro project.
I will honor our  agreement on the sell down; however, we have sufficient technical talent  internally and externally to manage this job.
I see very little effort in  continuing to waste internal time in ENA and EECC on this discussion.
Regards
