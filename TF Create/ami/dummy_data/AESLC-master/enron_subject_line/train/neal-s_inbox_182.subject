Scott,  As discussed yesterday we really appreciate your help in moving the negotiations along for the Master with Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company.
Just to give you some facts: We do have a GISB with Williams, of which they are the Confirming Party.
Williams has made a decision not to confirm any deals less than a month in term, this is breach of contract.
We currently have over 800 deals pending execution as they are not sending paper.
