We have an official domain name now, www.eastmontrose.org, and a web site for general information and informative links.
I will be managing the domain and site, so please let me know if you have any suggestions.
This will not take the place of our email list server, but be an adjunct to it.
Thanks in advance for any ideas,  Deanna Jackson
