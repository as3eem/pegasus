Dan, is it possible to see the AReM response to the Wood ACR before it is filed tomorrow?
I am going to be preparing  the written prehearing conference statement for Enron to be submitted to Barnett at the nov. 7 PHC and I want to make sure we are being consistent in our approach.
Thank you.
Mike Day
