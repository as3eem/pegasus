Clem:  I know that you sent Sheila Glover a form of ENE guaranty a few weeks ago.
Sheila forwarded it to Bear and we received Bear's form which is  unacceptable.
However, if ENE has outstanding guaranties in favor of Bear, I  would need to know since we may be able to use a previously negotiated form.
Can you let me know if ENE has ever issued such a guaranty?
Thanks.
