Sorry I didn't respond very promptly to your last email.
Things have been  very emotionally draining for me around here.
I'm going to forward some of  my recent email communications to catch you up on the issue.
After you've  had a chance to take in the situation I would really love to hear your  opinion.
Call or email with any insights.
