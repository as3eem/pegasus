We had some problems with Netscape on Saturday.
The El Paso scrape was down from 5AM through the end of my night shift.
Dave Steiner was notified early in the afternoon and I was told it was a problem in Houston.
The problem should be solved by Sunday.
Problem it caused:  I was not able to download HA finals from the ISO and finals were not created.
