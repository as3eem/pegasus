Hello there,  Here's the LV Co Gen break out contract with the assortment of turbines,  including the 3 turbines from the new order.
I haven't quite figured out the  route, but I think this is the correct destination.
Due to the Delta schedule, it would be very helpful to get closure on this  form by April 10th.
