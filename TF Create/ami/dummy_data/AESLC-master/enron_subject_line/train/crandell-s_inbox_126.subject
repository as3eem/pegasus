Attached are EPMI's comments that I will deliver orally on Monday afternoon at the FERC.
I am also attaching some backup slides, a listing of who will be on the two panels, the statement by Naeve on behalf of PGE, and statement Tabors on behalf of a TFG subset.
I want to re-read Tabors one more time but I expect that will we sign on in support.
