In the Master Letter Log (version 3/20/02) Belco is included with the early termination made by Westport Resources Corporation.
We currently have Belco as a live (non-terminated) CP but this may be incorrect.
Please review the Master Letter Log AND the termination provided by Westport Resources to determine whether Belco is included in that early termination.
Thanks
