Hello Mr. Lay,  I want to thank you for returning my call yesterday afternoon in regards to my message and providing me an update to the retention policy.
Considering your extremely busy schedule, your call and message demonstrates your continued commitment to the Enron employees, and I truly appreciate it.
I do feel I should apologize to you for contacting you at home, my fianc?
seemed I should have contacted you at work, and as I am starting to realize she is right in most respects.
Thank you once again,
