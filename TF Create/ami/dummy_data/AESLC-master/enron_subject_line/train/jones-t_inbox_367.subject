Tana, I received a PA for Straightline (Division of U.S. Steel) and credit approved.
I ask Global to create an CP ID.
and the ID reads.
Straightline, a dba of US Steel Corporation.
Do I have to ask customer to re-fax PA with GCP name, CP ID # 142509?
or is okay to process like Straightline ( Division of U.S. Steel) ?
Let me know, Thank you,
