Hi Kent,  I don't know whether Lee has mentioned the Delta Power deal that we are  working on.
We are taking 4 turbines and putting them in an LLC, and selling  some of the interest in the LLC to Delta Power.
Three of the turbines are  turbines formerally known as LV Co Gen turbines, and we are buying new LM's  to replace the ones we are using here.
In any event, Delta Power is  financing the deal, and they have asked that we get GE sign off on the  attached documents.
Therefore, I would be interested in your response to the  attached.
I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today, but I'll send him a copy  anyway.
Thanks,
