Judge  Birchman's November 23rd Order sets January 8, 2002 as the hearing date for  202(c) issues.
As we discussed during the November 20th phone conference, the  witness for the State Water Contractors, Richard Jones, is not available for  cross examination on January 8th.
As we agreed during the phone conference, Mr.  Jones will be available during the December hearing dates for cross examination  on the 202(c) issues.
Since he will be traveling in for the hearings we need to set a date within  the December hearings when the cross examination (if any) will take place.
We suggest that he be available on December 21st, the last day of the  December hearings.
If anyone prefers that he be available on a different date,  please advise us by the end of the this week (November 30th) so that travel  plans can be made.
Sincerely,
