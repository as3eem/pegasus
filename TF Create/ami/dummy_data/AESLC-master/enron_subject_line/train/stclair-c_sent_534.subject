Adele: I have given the opinion to Susan to get signed.
We are waiting to receive  the Texas good standing certificate which we were told may come by tomorrow.
Susan will send you everything else by fed ex tonight and it is my  understanding that  we are considering the Master to be effective with our  opinion to follow.
Thanks for your help on this.
It was a pleasure to work  with you and Maria.
