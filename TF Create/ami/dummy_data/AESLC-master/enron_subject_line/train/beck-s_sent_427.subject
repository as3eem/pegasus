I interviewed Analyst/Associate candidates in the office on Saturday, as did  four other directors/senior directors from Energy Operations.
I completed  the evaluations of the four candidates that I interviewed and submitted  those, but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to  commitments to attend a funeral.
I talked with Ted Bland this morning and he  suggested that I provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in  Energy Operations.
Analysts  Tara Piazze - potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams  Joseph Piotrowski - AA consulting background; would be a good fit for my  operations team focused on EOL (these are ENA employees) -- I need to add
