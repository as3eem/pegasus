Nancy,  I've made a list of the transactions I see in the VEPCO deal.
Perhaps you  can think of more.
I would appreciate your suggestions for B & P lawyers to  assist with these various aspects of the deal, with local counsel input as  necessary.
Additionally, I would like to have someone in the Houston office  involved for backup.
last minute meetings, etc.
Thanks for your help.
