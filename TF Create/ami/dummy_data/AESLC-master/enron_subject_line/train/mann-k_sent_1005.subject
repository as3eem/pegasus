Hi Guys,  Enron policy requires that the assignment of tasks to outside counsel go  through (or at least be coordinated with) the legal department.
In the  future, please let me know what you need so that there can be some order to  the process.
Did the Fehrs and Ledfords sign the option agreements?
Thank you,
