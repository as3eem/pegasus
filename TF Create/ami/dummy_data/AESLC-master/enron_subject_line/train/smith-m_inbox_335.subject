Hey Mat!
How have you been?
I have been trying to call you to chat, but can't get through to you.
Is everything ok?
I wasn't sure exactly when you were going to Portland, so maybe you are there now.
If you don't want me to call, please let me know.
I hope all is well.
Please write me and let me know what's up!
Christine:)
