I have accepted a position with AEP's Portland office, effective today.
I do not have contact information at AEP yet, but if you wish to contact me you may do so by email at taperry1@attbi.com.
It has been a pleasure working with all of you over the past year and three quarters.
I wish you the best of luck in the future.
