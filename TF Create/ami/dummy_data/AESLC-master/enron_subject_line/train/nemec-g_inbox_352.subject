Dear Gerald:  I pulled up a "generic" TPA from Sandi Braband's files and there are some discrepancies between the old form and recent ones we've received from Shane.
Please call me tomorrow when you have a minute, so perhaps we can sit at a conference table and I can point out the differences one by one.
Then we can arrive at a concensus on how current forms should appear.
Thanks,
