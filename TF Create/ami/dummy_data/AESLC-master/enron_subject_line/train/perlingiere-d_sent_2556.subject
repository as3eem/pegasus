I am in final negotiations with FPC, hopefully this can be concluded today.
Ms. Murphy of FPC stated   Dustan is scheduled to be down for repairs and  delivery may not take place until the 5th?
In any case, should we not reach  agreement today, I will have the confirm desk send a confirm with GTC and  move the transaction to the finalized Master upon completion.
I will let you know by 5:00 today our status.
