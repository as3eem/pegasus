Cleaning out my mailbox, and I find this message from John Perschke reporting on homecoming, and requesting I sent you a note.
Sorry to delay; things have been just exquisitely busy here at work the past few months.
So I'll send a quick note, and more when I hear back from you (the email address looks suspicious, so I'll verify it first).
Big project is just wrapping up, so I'll have more spare minutes soon, I hope.
Hope all is well with you.
Still in Houston?
