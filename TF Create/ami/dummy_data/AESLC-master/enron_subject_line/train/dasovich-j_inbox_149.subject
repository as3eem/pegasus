As of this point in time, the CPUC is NOT expected to vote tomorrow.
The CPUC has not said when a new meeting would be held.
Although we continue to keep the pressure on, the CPUC vote could be for DA suspension as of July 1.
We need to be prepared to take immediate legal action in that event.
Here is the plan and what we'd like from customers.
