Per:  I am told that Mark Taylor sent an email in December to Bob Shultz at EOL  addressing the hedge fund issues (and CTA issues) associated with online  trading and that you and Caroline received that email.
Apparently the hedge  fund crises of last year have heightened regulatory scrutiny of the funds'  derivatives activity.
EOL does not want to be subjected to any regulatory  oversight.
I have not seen the email yet.
I will broach the subject with  Mark when he returns to the office.
