We need to talk about instantaneous supply and how it is dealt with under your Sand Hills contract.
The contract I am working on with Austin really doesn't address this issue and in order for me to include this in the contract we will need to talk.
I have a call in also with Lonestar to talk about this as well.
I have Janet Wallis helping me address some of these issues.
We may want to schedule a meeting to include her also.
Let me know where we stand.
