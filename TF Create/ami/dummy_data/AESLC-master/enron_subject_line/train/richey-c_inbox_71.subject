Cooper,  So tell me how was you squash game?
Good I hope I have been so busy lately but I did get a game in yesterday but late and I had to go to the police gym with a friend cause I could not get a time at the Y but tonight I am playing there and have a court already so that really works for me.
Well I hope you are well and still able to meet up sometime.
Take care,
