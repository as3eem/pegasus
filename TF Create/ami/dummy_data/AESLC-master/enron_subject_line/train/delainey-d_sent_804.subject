Mike, as a policy offsites and retreats, especially more exotic and  expensive, are being discouraged.
I would prefer the Galveston offsite and I  don't see a need for more than one per year.
Please manage through PR -  Dorie Hitchcock - she will  require an agenda as part of the approval  process.
I would encourage some significant work discussion to be part of  the offsite.
If you have some concerns lets discuss.
Regards
