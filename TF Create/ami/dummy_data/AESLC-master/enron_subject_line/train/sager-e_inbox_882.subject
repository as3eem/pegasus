Attached is an amendment to the ENA/ Dynegy agreement regarding the Sithe deal.
It may require some clean-up but if you  would please consider whether this meets the objectives of cross defaulting ENA's payment obligations under the Letter Agreement and netting and setoff with the Master Netting Agreement.
Please call me with your comments as soon as possible.
Thanks!
