All,      We have seen some symptoms of problems with the voicemail system.
The Problem: The Message Waiting Indicator (MWT) on the Meridian phones is not lighting for several hours after new messages are received.
What we are doing about it: I have contacted PGE Telephone Services and they have opened a trouble ticket to have the problem looked into.
The workaround: If you are expecting messages or if you have not checked your messages in a while because you have not seen the MWT light, please proactively check your voicemail box by dialing x7600, hit the # key for you mailbox, and enter your password.
I will send out an update message when I have more news.
Regards
