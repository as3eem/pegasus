"Ambrosia" literally means "immortality" in Greek; it is = a                   derivative of the Greek word "ambrotos," meaning "immorta= l,"                   which combines the prefix "a-" (meaning "not") with=20 "-mbrotos"                   (meaning "mortal").
In Greek and Roman mythology, only                   immortals -- gods and goddesses -- could eat ambrosia.
