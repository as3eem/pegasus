Vince,  As mentioned in my voicemail, please find attached a speaker details form which I need you to fill in.
I have also reattached the draft programme.
At the end of the main conference agenda is an outline of the three seminars.
I am having great difficulty locating relevant people to speak on the operational risk seminar, and was wondering if you had any ideas.
I hope things are well with you and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Best wishes,
