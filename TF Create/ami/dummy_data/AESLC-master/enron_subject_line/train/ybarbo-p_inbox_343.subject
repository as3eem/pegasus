Hi all,  Paula Lacour has requested that I change the format of the pricing spreadsheet for the following 3 products: Premium Unleaded 93 Waterborne, Unleaded 87 USGC Waterborne and LS No.
2 Fuel Oil Waterborne to dollars per gallon (ex.
61.500 to now read .61500).
If there are no objections, this change will take place beginning Nov. 1st.
If you do not agree with this change please let me know.
Thank you,
