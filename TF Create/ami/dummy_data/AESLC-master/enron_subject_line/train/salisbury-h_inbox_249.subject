I regret to inform the Portland office that Tracy Ngo has resigned from her position effective immediately.
Although it will be tough to fill her shoes, Susan Rance (503/464-7086) will be coordinating with the rest of the credit department to help us address credit issues.
Please refer all questions and inquiries regarding credit to Susan.
Chris Calger and Tim Belden
