Ed,  I am still waiting for you to tell me which Deal Person is the contact for  the counterparty.
I need the Deal Person to initial the contract before an  officer will sign.
If I send it to Scott Neal or one of the other desk  heads, they will want the deal person to initial before they sign.
Therefore, I am still waiting on you to tell me who trades with this  counterparty.
I am holding the contract for that person.
If it is someone  on the HPL desk, then we have to start over because you requested that the  contract be done in ENA's name.
