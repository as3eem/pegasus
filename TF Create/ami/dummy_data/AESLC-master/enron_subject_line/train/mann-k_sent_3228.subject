FYI.
I don't know what I think about this email.
I will say that I've heard  good things about Clark, but haven't worked with him.
Also, there is a big  difference between a transmission project and a power project, since  tranmission assets are treated differently from an accounting standpoint.
Obviously, I don't consider the question of who is handling this (internally  or externally) to be resolved, pending further discussions.
