Chuck -  As we discusssed, attached is a marked version of the Participation Agreement which I have marked with some comments.
Though I understand that we have existing agreements with ICE that were pretty much unchanged I was not involved in the original discussions relating to these agreements.
I also understand the message you left relating to the reluctance of ICE to modify the agreement.
I only ask that you review the attached and let me know your thoughts.
Thanks for the cooperation and time.
Mark
