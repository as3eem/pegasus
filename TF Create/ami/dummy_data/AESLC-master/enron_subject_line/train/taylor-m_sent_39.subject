'Twas The Night Before Christmas as written by a lawyer  'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual  Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity  was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential (party of the  first part), including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus  musculus.
Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the  wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure  regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose  folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the  second part).
The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective  accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual  hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through  their cerebrums.
My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head  coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness  when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such  a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from  my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.
Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this  fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected  as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,  might be  said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my  incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered  conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,   piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble  that it  became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our  anticipated caller.
With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more  vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,  he vociferated loudly,  expelled breath musically through contracted  labia,  and addressed each of  the octet by his or her respective cognomen -  "Now Dasher, now Dancer..." et  al.
- guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through  which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the  32 cloven pedal extremities.
