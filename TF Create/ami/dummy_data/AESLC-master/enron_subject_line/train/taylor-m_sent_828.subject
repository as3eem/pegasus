Justin - are the EnBank contracts physical or financial?
It seems to me we  should use the same customer profiles - that is if the contracts are  physical, then any counterparty which can trade physical UK gas should have  access.
If the contracts are financial, then any counterparty that can trade  UK derivatives should have access.
