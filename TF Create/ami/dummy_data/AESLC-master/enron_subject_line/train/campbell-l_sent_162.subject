Advisors, presented below is a memo from GPG Houston requesting that we  provide to them the number of ETS employees in each team who have taken  advantage of the one year free membership with The Nature Conservancy.
Apparently there is some concern that employees are not taking advantage of  the opportunity which has been provided for them to get involved with an  organization that has some benefit towards wildlife and habitat preservation  and enhancement.
Should an employee desire to sign up for the one year free  memebership, the Conservancy the web address is www.tnc.org.
You can click  the button that says "Become a member" and sign up for the annual membership  at that time.
At the request of Mr. John Shafer, please provide to me a  total by  team of the number of individuals which have signed up with the  Nature Conservancy by the end of the month.
Your assistance in this is greatly appreciated
