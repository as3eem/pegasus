You lie like a dog.
What an affront to say, "MY family lost a lot of money this year too."
That's what you said at the Oct. 16 all-empoyee meeting.
How disgusting.
I am sure you have trouble finding health coverage.
Can't keep up your jet-setting lifestyle anymore?
Sure you can, you idiot!
Cheers!
See you in court.
