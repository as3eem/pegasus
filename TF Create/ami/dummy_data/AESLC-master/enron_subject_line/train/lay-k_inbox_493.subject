Move-in date for us is December 15th and your assistance is desired for selection of fabrics for KLL's furnishings.
You will appreciate that time is of the essence to be certain  his office is ready for move-in.
Please let me know, or you can contact Gary Napper directly at 713/345-3984 as to your earliest availability for meeting with him and the designer and architect, Jeffrey State.
They will tailor their schedule around yours.
Thanks Linda.
