Sorry I've been MIA this week...new job and all.
Thought you might get a  kick out of this email.
It's from that guy that is 25 but looks about 40.
And yet he resurfaces again (read the email at the bottom first then his).
Yes I will be attending the Taster's dinner this evening.
Look forward to  seeing you there.
