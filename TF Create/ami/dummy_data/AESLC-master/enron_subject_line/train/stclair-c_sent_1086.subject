Mary: I am beginning the process of looking for a nanny and was wondering if you  may know of someone or know of an agency that you trust.
We are looking for  someone to commute to our house each day.
If you do know of someone, please  let me know.
Also,  on Suzanne's gift, looks like so far it's me and Sheila   contributing.
Are you interested?
