Dave, I am going to send Shawn your way - he has extensive development, asset  and project finance experience.
I would like him under your supervision to  manage our coal power development strategy - like we discussed it could be a  very robust strategy with multiple exit points.
I strongly believe that coal  needs to come back into the stack and that the existing development teams  (Parquet & Jacoby) are already buried under mid-stream gas development  opportunities.
This would incorporate acquisitions, development, technology,  asset sales,  emissions credits & technology, fuel supply and power sales.
Please update your 2001 budget to incorporate this new iniative.
Regards
