I invite you to provide feedback on the Analyst & Associate Program, using a very short, anonymous and confidential survey.
In the very near future, you will receive an email from ramabile@execlead.com asking for feedback on your overall satisfaction with the Program, and your suggestion of one thing we should focus on for improvement.
To insure confidentiality of your responses, Executive Leadership has been engaged to conduct and compile the results of the survey.
The survey is designed to be completed in about two minutes, and your participation is important.
We plan to do short surveys like this a couple of times each year, in addition to the all employee survey.
As always, I invite each of you to contact me or anyone on my team if you'd like to discuss ideas or issues in person.
Thank you in advance for your participation,  Billy Lemmons
