DCongel@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Market Participants:  New advisory statements for April 2000 have been posted to your secure web sites as of 8/4/2001.
The reason for the update is due to a printing error in the previous version for LRR Uplift charges.
Some of you may have had problems getting the LRR dollars in line with what you were invoiced due to this printing error.
It is important to note that the bills were NOT re-run, just re-printed.
