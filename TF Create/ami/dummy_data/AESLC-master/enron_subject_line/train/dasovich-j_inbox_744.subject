The Indianapolis/Kansas City game is going to be played Thursday instead of Sunday so I'm sending a revised Pick Sheet for Week #8.
Please try to get your picks in as early as possible, but if you get your pick in for the Thursday game before it starts we'll count it and wait for the rest of the picks until Sunday.
Sorry we didn't catch the change earlier.
