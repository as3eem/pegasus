See attached revised schedule:  Primary Changes  NEPOOL requirement to pay accrued post- petition charges and start pre-paying for energy.
I understand Dave Gorte is aware of this decision by EPMI, EES and EEMC; and  We bought California gas through the end of the year today and payment is required tomorrow.
Sorry for the late changes.
Wade
