The notice announcing the public conference on El Paso's Full Requirements capacity allocation was issued and is attached.
The conference will be held on April 16 at 10:00 a.m.
The notice contains a reference to the Staff's proposal and a description of such.
The only "discussion paper" available is the power point presentation made at the March 13th open Commission meeting, which I am also attaching.
To note, during the discussion at that meeting it was indicated that this may be a Commissioner-level conference.
