Hi MARK!
The pictures arrived today.
Your letter was dated April 6 so it took ten days.
Tell Sukran Mother and I think she is beautiful.
We sure enjoyed seeing them all.
I made copies for Sue and Tom and will mail them this afternoon.
Thank you so much.
LOTS  of LOVE and KISSES to YOU and Sukran from MOTHER and I.
DAD
