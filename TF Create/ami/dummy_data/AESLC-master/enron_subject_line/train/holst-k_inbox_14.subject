Keith:  I had sent to you on August 14, an email regarding the extension of your L1A visa.
Please let me know if you wish to renew this before it expires on February 11, 2002?
If so, I will need you to complete the visa questionnaire form I sent to you and return to me with the required documents.
Please advise soonest.
Thanks
