Nov 1 2001 	108283		Engage Energy American	Nov 1 2001  	These are the SBA contracts that were provided during the due diligence.
I'd like to be able to verify and support that the changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority for these SBA contracts do not result in an impact to NNG's primary firm shippers.
Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks MW
