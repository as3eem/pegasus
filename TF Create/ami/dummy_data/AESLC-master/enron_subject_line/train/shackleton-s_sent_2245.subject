All:  I spoke with Kim this morning and although she is anxious to meet  everyone, we decided that it would be more productive to try to schedule a  luncheon meeting to discuss current issues related to the confirmation desk.
I understand that Joe Hunter, Melissa Murphy and David Dupre will be  providing Kim with a list of "issues" and we have been invited to add to that  list.
Please send me your list of any confirmation issues that you would like  raised with Kim which I will cumulate and forward.
You may ignore the message below.
Thanks.
Sara
