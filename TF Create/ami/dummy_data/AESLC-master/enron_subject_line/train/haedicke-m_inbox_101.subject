Attached, please find the final Robin Potts opinion.
All changes appear to have been made that were submitted last night.
Please note that when you click on the attachment, you will only be able to see the fax cover sheet, but when you print it, all pages are there.
I propose to post this opinion and the attached Memorandum to Members on our website as soon as possible today.
Accordingly, please let me know within the next hour if you have any questions.
