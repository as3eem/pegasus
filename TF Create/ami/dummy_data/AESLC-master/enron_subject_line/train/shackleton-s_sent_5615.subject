Jane:  Susan is trying to revise the Services Agreement once again and the  "governing law" issue was raised.
I do not have any memoranda addressing  which choice of law would be binding on Enron Japan Corp.
However, I note  that the draft ISDA marked by our Japanese counsel for use by Enron Japan  Corp. and IBJ elects New York law (AA email to me dated 9/21/00).
Are either  Texas or New York law preferable for the Services Agreement?
Thanks for your assistance.
Regards.
