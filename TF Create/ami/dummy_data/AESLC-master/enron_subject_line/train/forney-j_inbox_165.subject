John,  I made an adjustment in Enpower for Friday.
When balancing the books, I noticed that we were 100mw's long into the pool for HE21 & HE22, but in the portal it only shows 50mw for each hour.
(A 16hour block of 50mw was already in the portal.)
So I adjusted HE21 & HE22 from 50mw to 0 mw, so that it matched the portal.
Please notify me  if my adjustment was incorrect.
I made a note in the comment field for enpower #871228.
Joe
