Last month we were looking for a sword stand as Christmas gift for our Rice MBA stockbrokeress who is deeply into Japanese martial arts.
We finally found an inexpensive one on the Internet.
We may be the only people in the 'hood who hadn't eaten at Texas Chic, one block west of Leather by the Boots, on the other side of the street at 712?
Fairview.
It's been owned and operated for decades by Teodoro Gonzalez who lives on Bomar, next to the new townhouses.
He and his wife make great Puerto Rican food and watching him slice bananas while carrying on a conversation without taking his eyes off of you is unique experience.
