Drew would like to have a short meeting tomorrow (Oct. 30) at 11:00 a.m. to bring us all up to date on Enron's current problems and to try and answer any questions we might have.
The meeting shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
I have reserved 47C2 for those of us in Houston.
Ann:  Drew can call Greg in Omaha to conference everyone in or if you want to get a conference room, let me know the phone number he'll need to call.
Thanks,
