Dear Nicolas:  I am pleased that you found the Cancun meeting to be a good experience.
My  wife and I also thought if was a very enjoyable couple of days.
With reference to contacting the appropriate people representing Enron in  Mexico, you should contact either Jaime Alatorre or Max Yzaguirre.
Either  one of these individuals could entertain a discussion of how we might be able  to work together.
Best regards,
