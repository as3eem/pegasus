Fernley:  I think that you are right about easy access to the standards.
In  fact, at the Global Operations Controllers gathering in Houston in October,  we are going to roll out a website created for Global Risk Operations.
The  global standards will be one of the items included, as well as contact lists  for Operations Controllers worldwide, calendars for all Enron offices  worldwide, a "what time is it there if I am here" page, etc.
I would like  for this to be introduced at the offsite as surprise (just a little bang out  of the announcement) , so I would appreciate your not sharing this plan  widely at this point.
However, I thought that I would let you know so that  we would not duplicate any efforts.
