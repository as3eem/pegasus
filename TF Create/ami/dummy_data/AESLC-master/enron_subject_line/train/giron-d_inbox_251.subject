Did you go to the game this weekend?
UT looked strong after the first 20min.
Hopefully Neb.
and Tech can beat OU.
The A&M game looks like it could be more of a challenge than I had originally thought.
What's going on at Enron?
I saw where the SEC will be investigating an Enron partership.
What's your take on the situation there?
Let's go to lunch soon.
