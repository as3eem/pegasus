The following deals were done on eol, the upper time zone says PPT, but in the strip it says PST.
These have all been changed   568049.1 568051.1 568052.1 568053.1 568054.1 568055.1 568056.1 568057.1     Why do these deals show up as physical at all?
They are cross-portfolio deals.
I know we have had problems with them before,but I do not understand how a trade within the company is showing physical.
