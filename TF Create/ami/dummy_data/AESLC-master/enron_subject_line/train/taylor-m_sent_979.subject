Robbi:  The CFTC issued a Regulatory Framework for some new regulations in late  February, a copy of which is attached.
No proposed regulations have resulted  but could come out at any time now.
There is also some activity on the Hill  (bills percolating through various committees: House Banking, House  Agriculture and Senate Agriculture) which are also of interest.
We have been  monitoring these developments and I'd be happy to talk them over with you.
Please give me a call if you'd like at x37459.
