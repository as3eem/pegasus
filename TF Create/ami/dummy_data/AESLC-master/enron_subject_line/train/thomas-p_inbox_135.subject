How would you like meeting to discuss pooling our resources?
One of my responsibilities for East Power Trading/CRM, is generating load and HR curves for Nepool, NY, and PJM.
It's my understanding you have access and use some of the same data for your analyses.
My schedule is flexible.
At your convenience, please let me know your availability .
Thanks,
