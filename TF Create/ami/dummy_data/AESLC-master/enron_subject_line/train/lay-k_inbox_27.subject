Ken,  With your permission, Harry and I will plan to bring our golf clubs on the   airplane on Tuesday.
I plan to buy one of those little traveling golf bags   (very small) and carry only about 5 or 6 of my clubs with me.
Mick may or may   not do the same.
It's your call if this is OK for the plane and whether or   not you bring yours.
This way when Harry and I get to betting on the game,   we will not have the quality of the rent clubs as an excuse for the quality   of our game.
John
