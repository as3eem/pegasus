There are a growing number of things for us to discuss relative to gas supply for Pleasant Valley Station.
I would like to suggest the following dates to meet in Houston.
Choice #1:	November 13, a morning meeting  Choice #2:	Novemer 6, a morning meeting  Please let me know (and reply all in your response) if one or both dates work.
I will put together an agenda of the items for discussion.
