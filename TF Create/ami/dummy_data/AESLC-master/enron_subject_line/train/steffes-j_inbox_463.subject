Please note and inform your groups that Teresa Mihalik (5-7749) or myself (6-6363) should be the point people for any margin calls issued to EES.
We will work with Legal and Regulatory Affairs to validate rights to such calls.
Additionally, we will work with Trading to validate requirement calculations.
Thank You
