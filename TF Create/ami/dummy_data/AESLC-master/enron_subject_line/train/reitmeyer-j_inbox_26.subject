I called the company that makes the jewelry boxes to ask about their purses.
I think I have picked out one that I like, although it is difficult to see them on the net.
They can add the ATM to any of them and this is the last year they will be making them.
The purses look alot like Brighton, but are alot cheaper.
The one I think I like is only $45.00.
We need to make the order soon for the boxes.
heart me  Sandra called you.
Her work number is 713-692-8522.
She is the one calling for 100.
