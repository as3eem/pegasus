Teb - could you review the attached affidavit - which is substantially similar to the other 2 that you signed.
The only difference this time is the name of the plaintiffs.
If you could fill in the blanks for me as much as possible.
If not, I'll get them filled tomorrow.
If you're OK with it - I'll have Iris bring down an original for your signature and she'll notarize it.
THANKS!
