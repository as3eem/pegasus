I tried to send this to your juno address and it came back.
Just in case you  are home, I also received the following from the PR department a few minutes  ago: Be sure to watch Chairman and CEO Ken Lay on Fox News today.
He will appear  on "Our World" with Neil Cavuto at 4:30 p.m. CST to discuss Enron's year-end  financial and operating highlights.
