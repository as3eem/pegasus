Barry, we currently have six folks coming who all golf:   - Barry  - Lavo  - Delainey  - Ozzie  - Milly  - Yzaguirre   I would say we should golf everday.
I will get Kay to forward travel  schedules to you so that we can set up times where everyone can play as much  as possible.
My understanding is that we are all staying at the Mirage.
Regards
