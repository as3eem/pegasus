Mr. Bonnell: At Tanya's request I am sending you a draft of the amendment agreement which would include cash as eligible collateral.
I look forward to hearing from you and your attorney.
The reason why a cash margin payment is not a preference under the Bankruptcy Code is because Section 546 (g) specifically excludes payments made under swap agreements from the preference provisions.
I would be happy to speak with your attorney about this.
