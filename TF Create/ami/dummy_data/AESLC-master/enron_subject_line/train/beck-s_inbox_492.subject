Greetings everyone- With a week and a half to go until our second session, I wanted to check in and ask you to begin thinking in your learning teams about how you want to share the information you have been gathering with the larger group.

Keep in mind that most adults learn best experientially versus through straight information download.
Thus, if you can find a way to invite the larger group to sample the learning experience that you had, these sessions will be all the more effective AND enjoyable.
As an example, you could select two or three key moments -- from a meeting, interview or learning journey -- and
