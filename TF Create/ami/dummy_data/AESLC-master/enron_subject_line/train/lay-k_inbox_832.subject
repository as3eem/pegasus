Mr. Lay,  I know you are extremely busy so I will keep this short.
Do you have any contacts with ABN AMRO or BANC One in Chicago?
They are building new offices and I know I would qualify to do something even short term.
Can you provide to me a few contacts to get in the door, please....?
Any contacts in Chicago would be great.
If you need to verify my performance with ECS please contact Lance Jameson.
I was a Project Manager for the Network and relocation activities.
