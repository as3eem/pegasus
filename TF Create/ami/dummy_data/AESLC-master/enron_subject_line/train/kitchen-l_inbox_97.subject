Dear Louise-  I had a request from Keith Fraley as he was departing...
He is interested in purchasing from Enron the equipment used by his group for the mapping function.
This would include a couple of PC's, a couple of servers and the big plotter.
Is this something that can be pursued?
Please let me know..
Thanks,
