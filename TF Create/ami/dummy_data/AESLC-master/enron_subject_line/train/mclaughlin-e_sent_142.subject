Jeff,  I wanted to give you an update on George's start date.
He is finishing up a  project currently, and is looking at February 19th as a start date.
However,  he feels that there is a strong possibility that he will finish earlty and be  able to start on Feb. 12th.
I will keep you updated.
Thanks,
