In preparation to present offers to APS, Duke, and Panda, the following tasks need to be completed-  James, Teb, Blair to calculate rates for $911 MM facilities according to the following guidelines-  - Rate matrix based on contract terms of 15/20/25/30 years  - Project depreciation consistent with contract term - Segmented rates (max rate) - Levelized - Volume allocations: SJ-780k/d; Cal Border-330k/d; Phoenix;500k/d - Incremental O&M costs charged to new shippers prior to next rate case; O&M costs re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.
- Incremental fuel retention charged to new shippers prior to next rate case; fuel costs re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.
- Determine rate sensitivity (for 15/20/25/30 year terms) assuming +/- $25 MM change in cost of new facilities - Determine rate sensitivity (for 15/20/25/30 year terms) assuming +/- $2 MM change in O+M re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.
