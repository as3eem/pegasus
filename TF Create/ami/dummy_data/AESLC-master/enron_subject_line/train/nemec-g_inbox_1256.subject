In a continuing effort to align the legal groups with the business groups, the Power Trading and East Origination/Gas Trading Groups have merged to form the Energy Group of the Wholesale Legal Department.
The Energy Group will be co-headed by Jeff Hodge and Elizabeth Sager.
While the work handled by the new group will be essentially the same work handled by the predecessor groups, the new structure will give more opportunity for training across the commodities.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
