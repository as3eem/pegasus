I have talked to Penny Price 614-460-5540 about the letter COH sent to our customers.
We estimate we have lost 5-10% of our customers effective for January because of this letter.
She was to have their attorney, Dave Keenan, call me but I haven't heard from him yet.
I told her we will want a clarifying letter to go out and a retraction to the statement "Enron may or may not be able to supply your customer needs."
A gas contact at the OH PUC is Kerry Adkins 614-752-9374.
I have told other staffers of the problem ( Tamara Turkenton of Consumer Services) and she gave me Kerry's name.
