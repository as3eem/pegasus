Tom,  See the email below for the ID and password.
Call me on Monday to discuss the download process, if you should have any  questions.
You will log into www.enrononline.com and I think you will need  to download shockwave media (the site should walk you through this process).
Once you have typed in the ID and password, you will then have the option of  setting up a personalized quote page.
Also, call me about where to see our  posted daily indices each day on the website.
Enron releases the weighted  average of all gas traded at each physical point every day.
Thanks,
