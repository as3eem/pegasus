Andy,  I am sending you a draft oof a proposal regarding national forum for top  finance practitioners and academics.
The idea came from a professor at Rice University who has already received a commitment from a number of most distinguished CFOs.
Please, read the outline and see if you would be interested in joining this  forum.
I shall be glad to help to arrange  a meeting with Prof. Ikenberry.
Vince
