The cancer journey is sometimes lonely and frustrating for both those suffering with the disease and those providing care.
But it can also be a time of friendship, personal growth, humor, and fulfillment.
Please join Marlene Lockey, Sr. Social Work Counselor at MD Anderson Cancer Center on Wednesday, August 15, 2001 at 11:30 a.m. in the Forum in 2AC (12th floor) for a Brown Bag session on "Caring for the Caregiver."
Marlene has many stories to share, as well as many ways to cope with the challenges of living with cancer.
The presentation will be followed by an audience discussion, so please bring your questions and experiences.
Contact Laura Herrera -laura.herrera@enron.com  - if you would like to attend.
