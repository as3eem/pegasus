Michelle:  Here is the first response I received from one of our senior partners in SF:  I think the best thing such a client can do is to use a reputable security outfit (such as Kroll Associates) to give the co. a very thorough assessment.
I think, quite frankly, that relying on the advice of such an outfit would provide more legal protection than talking to all of the lawyers in the world, although our advice could be an additional benefit.
As you know, we have an extensive task force report on workplace violence that would be relevant to this inquiry and could provide the basis for an analysis of this issue, although other areas would have to be explored.
I am soliciting comments about the HR consultant you referenced.
