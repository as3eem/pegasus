Hi Scott,  I have some questions:  The obligation to try to improve performance  about the specific performance  (ie minimum) standards frequently has a time limit, say 6 months.
Do you  have a sense for the appropriate time period here?
Would it make sense to  require them to work longer on the first 2.0 and 2.4 than the rest?
Will we have a drawing number for a standard foundation design, or will we  need to put words around it.
I know we discussed the need for pilings as the  most significant change.
Do you think that this difference is enough?
Did I  understand that we want them to pay us at the end for non-standard  foundations (as opposed to a credit).
