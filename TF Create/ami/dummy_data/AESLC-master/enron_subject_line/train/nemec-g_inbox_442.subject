Gerald,  Just to let you know, I scheduled a meeting with Roger Westbrook on this Thursday, Sept 27 at 2 pm.
If it's okay with you, we can just meet in your office at that time.
The two main issues to discuss are the plat and legal description for Sorrento and the Bridgeline-Crawfish agreement.
Please let me know if this doesn't work for you.
Talk to you soon,  Rakhi x3-7871
