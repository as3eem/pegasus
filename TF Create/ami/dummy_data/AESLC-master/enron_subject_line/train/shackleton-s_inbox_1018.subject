Sara - there are outstanding issues in this table.
I am trying to determine the following today: Does the Paribas loan cover initial and variation margin?
My reading of the docs is that the loan does.
The back office tells me that Paribas only funds initial margin under this loan.
How much is EDF's loan for?
The number has been reduced and I am not sure where it stands.
