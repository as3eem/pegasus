Latest Tino-gram:  Apparently high power prices at 4 Corners have DOE excited  about the project all of a sudden.
The latest configuration is in the  300-380 mw range.
Tino needs us to check if the ENA guys would be interested  in buying the surplus capacity on a demand charge basis (I think these are  basically tolling agreements--ENA would pay a monthly capacity reservation
