As an FYI, from time to time I will be preparing NDAs for the Networks team  headed by Mark S. Palmer working with Travis on "Project Offline".
Project  Offline has evolved a form of NDA and added a non-solicitation clause and a  residuals clause.
I wanted you to be familiar with the form in case Travis  is not here, you,as are my backup lawyer for the Networks team.
The form,  like all my Networks forms is kept in my "Confidentiality Agreements"  subdirectory under "Forms" (in case you ever need it and I'm not around).
