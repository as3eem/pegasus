Rod:  For the summarized financial info page you gave me:  1)  Can we exclude Border and T'blazer from schedule?
2)  How can I get the detail behind the revenue and expense line items?
(contracted capacity, rates, etc.)
There appears to be confusion on what lawyers are working on this.
Mark Hadeke appears to be on this for McMahon, Mintz for Global Finance.
Hadeke doesn't want to use V&E for this effort.
May need your help on this one.
call me.
Kevin
