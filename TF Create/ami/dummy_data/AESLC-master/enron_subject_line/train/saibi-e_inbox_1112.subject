Dear MetrixND Users,  Based on the results of our recent user survey regarding what Windows platforms you are using, we have decided to eliminate testing and support of MetrixND version 3.0 on Windows 95.
The small fraction of you that are currently running a Windows 95 environment will need to upgrade to at least Windows 98 to run MetrixND version 3.0.
RER will still support previous versions of MetrixND that run on Windows 95, however we encourage all users to run the most current version.
MetrixND version 3.0 will be tested on the following platforms:
