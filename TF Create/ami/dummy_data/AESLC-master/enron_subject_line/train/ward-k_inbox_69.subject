Kim- Here is the August spreadsheet.
These are the changes I've made so far:  I changed the formula in column R I added in the new contracts for August  The differences between my model and the invoice are the way that they calculate the actual gas flow to Malin (column L on mine and column Z on theirs);  It also appears that they do not include the Redwood credit.
Looking at my model now, I also don't remember what the calculation in column D is for.
It seems kind of unnecessary to me and doesn't make much sense.
I know this is a lot of stuff to look at.
If you don't understand what I just wrote, ask me and I'll explain what I'm trying to say.
Thanks,
