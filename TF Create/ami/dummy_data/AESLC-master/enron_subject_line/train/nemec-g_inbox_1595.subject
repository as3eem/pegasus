In celebration of my birthday this weekend my brother and a good friend of mine are coming to Houston Thursday night through Sunday.
We are going straight to PF Chang's on Westheimer from the airport, and should be there no later than 7-7:30.
After dinner we will head over to Taco Milagro or similar for the rest of the night.
This is an open invitation to anyone who would like to meet us at either place.
My cell is 678.592.8550 if you want to get an update.
Hope to see you there, and please feel free to pass this on.
