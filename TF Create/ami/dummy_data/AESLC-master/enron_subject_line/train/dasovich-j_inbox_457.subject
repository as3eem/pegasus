Ray Alvarez brought to my attention today a news item indicating that the Congressional Budget Office released a report earlier this week entitled "Causes and Lessons of the California Electricity Crisis."
The 30+ page report is available on the home page of the CBO's web site at www.cbo.gov.
I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable.
For example, the summary says:  "Much of the blame for California's electricity crisis attaches to the state's restructuring plan -- but not to its objective, electricity deregulation.
(...)  But deregulation itself did not fail; rather, it was never achieved."
