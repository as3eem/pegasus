I wanted to check with you on this.
All these deals are entered in your book,  and I know the Services desk typically does their own confirmations with  counterparties.
However, these deals have comments in them that say they  replace other deals.
In that case, would you like them confirmed by Houston?
Let me know.
Thanks,
