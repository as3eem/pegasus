Here are the preliminary reports ready for your review.
I have not had a great deal of time to thoroughly review the data, so please review for accuracy.
TK - Please update the daily rates for contract 27495 (Astra) and verify the rates in blue.
I will be out of the office until Wednesday 11/28/01.
Therefore, please provide updates/comments by COB 11/27/01 so I can incorporate and forward to Omaha for filing with the FERC.
Thanks,
