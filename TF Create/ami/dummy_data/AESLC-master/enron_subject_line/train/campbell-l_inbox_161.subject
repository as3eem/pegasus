market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Market Participants:  Due to today's unfortunate incidents in New York City and the rest of the country and the resulting high level of internet traffic, some Market Participants have reported problems submitting their bids and seeing their schedules over the internet.
This is not a problem with the NYISO markets, which are functioning normally.
If you experience any communication problems, we encourage you to contact your NYISO customer account representative or the NYISO Customer Relations help desk line at (518) 356-6060.
If necessary, someone in Customer Relations can help you input your bids or relay your schedule information to you.
Sincerely,
