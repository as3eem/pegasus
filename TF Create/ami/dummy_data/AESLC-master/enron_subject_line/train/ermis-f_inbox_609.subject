Hey,  Peggy Hedstrom is working on having an EOL physical product created for internal use (or external if you wish).
We will be able to buy and sell Kingsgate gas with you with this product, no legal problems.
You should hopefully be able to just link it to either your Stanfield or Malin (preferably) product.
We'll let you know when it's ready, they're thinking Monday morning.
