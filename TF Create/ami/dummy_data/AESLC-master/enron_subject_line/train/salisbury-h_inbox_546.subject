Good Afternoon Folks  I am sure this will come up in a month or so.
We bought 20 mw from Mirant at 4 Corners for 9/27 and 9/28.
Mirant cut the schedule for 9/28 because they could not get transmission.
We are accepting this cut.
We re-supplied our downstream and no LD's are to be billed per Mark and Holden.
I changed the volume to Zero in scheduling, and wrote a note there.
Lemmie know if there is trouble with this.
