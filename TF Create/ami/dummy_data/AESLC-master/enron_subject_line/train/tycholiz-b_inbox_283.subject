Talked to Mark.
First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
