We would like to inform everyone that PwC has created a comprehensive position report with data obtained from the gas mid-office.The report checks gas curve positions each Friday from 11-30-01 to 2-1-02 (ten periods).
It will tell you the first start date and the last end date of positions on each curve we are reviewing.
Thanks again for all of your help.
Regards,
