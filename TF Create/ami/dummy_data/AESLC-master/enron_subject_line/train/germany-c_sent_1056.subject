Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May.
This is the first time I've heard about this.
I believe Joanie said this  capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us.
I need to know if we have to take this space.
I would prefer not to take the  space if we don't have to.
Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management  group.
