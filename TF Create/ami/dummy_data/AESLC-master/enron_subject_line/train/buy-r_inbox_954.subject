Rick,      A slight clarification on the RoCaR as it pertains to Market/Credit side:  The analysis is performed only on DASHed deals, so nearly all of deals going through Market/Credit would end up in Underwriting too, for which Mark Walker is the RoCaR contact.
This analysis is currently not done on traded deals which are not DASHed.
