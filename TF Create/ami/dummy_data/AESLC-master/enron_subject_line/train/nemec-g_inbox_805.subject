Dear Steve:  The Texas Railroad Commission doesn't have anything in its records that certain assets held by the subject company were divested to KN Processing, Inc., a subsidiary of KN Energy, Inc. on 3/31/1997.
We've tried to tell the Texas Railroad Commission that we no longer own this company, but since KN hasn't filed the proper reports for a number of wells for which it is shown to be a gas nominator and/or gas gatherer, the Commission is still looking to us to file reports like the P-5 for this entity.
Do you remember who handled the sale of this company to KN Processing, Inc.?
I don't know where to begin to do the research about this company or these wells.
Please advise, and thanks, Mary x37796
