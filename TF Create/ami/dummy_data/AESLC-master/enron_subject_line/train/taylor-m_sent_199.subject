Could you guys please get in touch with Andrea Bertone in Sao Paolo & send  her copies of our forms that might be useful in coming up with appropriate  documentation for this transaction.
Sara - you should probably discuss with  her the regulatory situation and make sure we can actually do this.
Brent  may have some information as well.
Thanks,
