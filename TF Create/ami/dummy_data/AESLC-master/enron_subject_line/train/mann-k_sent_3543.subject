Hi Wilson,  I haven't forgotten you, I just got tied up.
This is a very preliminary draft, but thought you should take a look at it.
I don't need a detailed analysis, I just want you to have it so that we can  discuss the impact of Mississippi law.
I am specifically interested in discussing the following:  waivers of consequential damages, limitations of liability  legal status of MDEA (I'll send you the info of what I have)  dispute resolution and jurisdiction  restrictions on confidentiality restrictions  any other aspects of the agreement impacted by Mississippi law  I don't need any memos, just a discussion.
Thanks,
