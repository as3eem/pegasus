Victor,  As discussed, we need to engineer a tie-in to Peerless so that we have a way to periodically turnover (by selling) our fuel oil inventory to before it goes bad.
James McMillan will forward to you a scope of work and cost for an engineer to go to site to develop the tie-in design.
This cost should be between $5 and 10K.
Once finalized, please issue an Eco PO to perform this work.
Rick
