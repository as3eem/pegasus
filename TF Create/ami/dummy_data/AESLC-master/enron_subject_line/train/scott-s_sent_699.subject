Sometimes I really worry about you...
I know it's not kind to laugh at the misfortune of others, but I must say I  was rolling when I read your email.
It's a good thing I didn't send the  other card I was debating over last night which alluded to the possibility of  you and Darren spending too much time together (not as funny in light of your  shack last night).
So how did you explain your attire this morning to your  MD?
Hope the presentation was a rousing success.
