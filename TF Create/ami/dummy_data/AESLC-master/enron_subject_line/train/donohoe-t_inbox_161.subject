Hey Guys,  I would like to get together this afternoon around 3:30pm to discuss how we will handle our business during a hurricane.
Issues that we probably need to address are rankings, contracts and possible re-routes and alternative sources of gas.
This should only take about 30minutes.
Thanks Lisa
