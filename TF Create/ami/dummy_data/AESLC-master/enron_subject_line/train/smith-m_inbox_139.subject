All, Enclosed is a list of specific cities that we are planning to scrape for the weather database.
It is sorted by state.
Please look this over and let me know about any other cities that need to be included in the list.
Keep in mind that we will be using this data primarily for models, so look for cities you think will be important to your area of concern.
Don't worry about the station ID or the WBAN codes, I will take care of those.
Please let me know by the end of the day Wednesday.
Thanks,
