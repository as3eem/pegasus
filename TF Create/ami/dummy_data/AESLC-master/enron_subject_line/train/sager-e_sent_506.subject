great - here is brochure.
I will try to get list of attendees so we can see  who is going; usually in east, crowd is primarially legal and credit; WSPP  meetings in west however generally have more commercial ... so I don't know  if Stuart would benefit or not but I would love for him to come if he wants.
Talk to you soon.
