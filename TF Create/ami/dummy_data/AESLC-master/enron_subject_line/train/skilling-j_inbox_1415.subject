Jeff,   Congratulations!--on  your amazing successes and your uncanny ability to make good  decisions.
I've always held you in the highest regard for being the  smartest person I ever worked with.
I'm certain it's been a tough few  weeks as you wrestled with your choice.
In a small way I can relate and if  others were willing to speak out you would find that you're far from  alone.
