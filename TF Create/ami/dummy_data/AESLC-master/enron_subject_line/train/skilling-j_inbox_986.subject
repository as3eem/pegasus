The Enterprise Storage Team will be migrating UNIX home directories and applications to new hardware on October 13 and 14, 2001.
The migration will begin on Saturday the 13th at 7:00 PM and will be completed by 1:00 AM on Sunday, October 14, 2001.
The migration requires a total system outage, so home directories and applications will not be available during the above time period.
Please log off before you leave for the weekend.
Development teams members will test all migrated applications on Sunday, October 14, 2001.
