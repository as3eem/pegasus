Greg,  I wanted to forward this letter to you that I received from a good friend of  mine who is interested in discussing global steel trading oppotunities with  Enron.
If you don't mind, I would like to have Chase Belew call you to  possibly set up a meeting.
I work on the west gas trading desk.
You can reach me at x37031.
Thank you  for your assistance.
Sincerely,

@subject
