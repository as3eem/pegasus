Postle,  I just did a download from Global Facilities of all the delivery points associated with Mid-C, NP15, SP15 and Rockies.
You might want to get with Kara (or someone else in scheduling) to determine which points are still actively used.
If you find that you're deleting alot more than you're keeping (as was our case), simply highlight the ones you want to take forward to UBS and send the file to Kim Theriot.
Let me know if you have any questions!
Casey
