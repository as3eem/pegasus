In order to maximize the potential synergies between the various mid- and back- office functions, to decrease replication errors, and to increase communication standards; are there any plans of creating a platform or reference center to bridge the differences between the systems, processes, and terminology of the various departments.
Perhaps a common resource center offering access to on-line system manuals and business unit overviews (which currently exist only in paper form or in some cases within the actual system database).
The reason: With Enron's size and transaction volume, many of the functions and the data managed by various groups within Enron (i.e.
credit, risk, settlements, volume management, global contracts, global counterparties, global rates, and the commercial systems) are fragmented.
Having participated in various process reviews and trouble-shooting/clean-up projects there seems to be a large disconnect between groups operating in various systems.
These disconnects; rather they be lack of information or understanding of how data flows between systems, how the data managed within each system impacts other upstream or downstream systems, or how the business processes within one group/system impacts the overall functionality of other groups, create large cracks producing an opportunity for mismanaged data, incomplete business reports, and increased risk to Enron.
The ideal objective; increase communication standards through a better understanding of system data functions/requirements and business processes, decrease system downtime and replication errors through a better understanding of the data relationships between systems, maximize department-to-department synergies (left hand knows what the right hand is doing), eliminate repetition, and further reduce potential risks to Enron due to information/business process oversight.
