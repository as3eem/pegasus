Dear Jeff,      Heard about the pie episode today in California.
From all the press accounts I've read, it sounds like you handled what had to be a difficult situation admirably and, in the immediate wake such adolesence, still managed to clearly and articulately make your case about what's been going on out there.
Congratulations---hats off to you, Jeff.
I am glad you
