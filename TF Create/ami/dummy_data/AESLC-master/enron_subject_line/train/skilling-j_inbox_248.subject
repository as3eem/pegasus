Jeff, I've attached a copy of the letter describing the loan of the Madeline O'Connor piece to the McNay Museum in San Antonio this summer.
Please let me or Betty Moody at Moody Gallery know if you have any questions.
Also, have you had a chance to make a decision about a piece for the niche between the boys' rooms?
Thanks.
Leigh Edwards
