Celeste,  I would like to ask you for a favor.
We would like to have Sevil as an intern  in our group this summer.
She prepares a Ph.D. dissertation  on transmission: a critical  issue to the power markets everywhere.
I have also a few other students I would like to take in as summer interns.
I  shall send you  the resumes in separate messages.
Vince Kaminski
