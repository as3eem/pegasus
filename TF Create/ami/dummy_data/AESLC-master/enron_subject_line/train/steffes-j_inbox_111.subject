Please find attached EES' revised Cash Forecast for 12/17/2001.
This has been updated to reflect new estimates for Gas and Power Purchases to get us through the holidays.
Also, I put in $10MM of EFS receipts for tomorrow as it is my understanding that there is that much additional received not yet deposited.
I  have not forecasted any disbursements for Wed - Friday assuming they get in.
