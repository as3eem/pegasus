Steph:  FYI, I had a conversation with Estella Chu (sp?)
of GLCC this morning.
She wanted a monthly MTM report (which apparently Craig Breaslow's (sp?)
group used to provide) and also wanted information about terminating the contract.
I instructed her to fax to you and write-in to the contract notification address her issues, including her request to terminate.
She also asked for your phone number, which I provided, so you may be getting a call from her (or may already have received a call from her).
