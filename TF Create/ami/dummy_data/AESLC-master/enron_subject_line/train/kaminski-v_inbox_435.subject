Hi folks, Sadly, this is my last day at Enron in Houston.
I've been here two years and 2 days, and have had a great time working here.
The longer I have been here, the better I have liked working here - probably because I got to know you all better.
If you are in New Zealand any time in the next 5 or 10 years, I would like you to stay at my house and update me on life at Enron - we will be living in Wellington, which is at the bottom of the North Island.
Contact details are:  tomhal@attglobal.net  95 Wyndham Road Upper Hutt, Pinehaven New Zealand   regards to all
