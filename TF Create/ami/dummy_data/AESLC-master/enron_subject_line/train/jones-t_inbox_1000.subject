Lorie -  Please see the attached version of the LOI.
I have added a paragraph - paragraph 6 - as a non-solicitation provision.
Be aware that these usually are negotiated to be mutual and, in that event, I will be required to obtain approval of a mutual provision at three different levels, including Corp.
This is current policy within the company to ensure we do not bind other divisions or groups to a non-solicit that we cannot comply with.
Let me know your thoughts.
Mark
