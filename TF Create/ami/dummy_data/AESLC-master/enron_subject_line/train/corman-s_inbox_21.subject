Hi, Shelley.
As SPRC chair, I wanted to visit with you sometime over the next couple of days about this janitorial situation.
Ernie supplied me with the prototype letter you prepared, as well as your comments about the independent contractor legalities, responsibilities, etc.
I could use your advice on this subject to ensure the correct decisions are being made.
