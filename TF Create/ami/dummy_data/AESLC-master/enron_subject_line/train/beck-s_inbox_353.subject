Hi Sally,  I hope this message finds you well.
Just a short note to let you know that I have settled into my workspace at EB 3089F.
I am very excited about my summer internship with Enron, and when you have a free moment, let me know; I would like to stop by and say "hi".
Feel free to contact me at (713) 853-4750 or at michelle.yee@enron.com with any questions.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Have a great day,  Michelle
