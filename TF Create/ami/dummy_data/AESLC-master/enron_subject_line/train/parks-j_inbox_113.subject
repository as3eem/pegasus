By now you have probably heard about three memos that discuss questionable trading strategies at Enron involving the California market.
The memos were brought to the Board's attention several days ago, and the Board voted on Sunday to waive the attorney-client privilege with respect to those documents.
On Monday, we turned the memos over to the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission and other appropriate agencies.
There are likely to be a number of investigations into this issue, and as we have with all current investigations, we will cooperate fully with these efforts.
If you should be contacted in regard to this matter, I encourage you to contact Bob Williams in our legal group at 713-345-2402.
However, while these investigations continue to look into the past, our focus must be on the future and on moving this company forward.
Thanks for your continued efforts,
