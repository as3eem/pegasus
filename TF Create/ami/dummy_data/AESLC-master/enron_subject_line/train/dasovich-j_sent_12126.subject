Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for  years (Published July 24, 2001)  The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more  intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee  sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn  over internal documents.
Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has  adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple  investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high.
And it has  become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians.
At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted  criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay.
"I would love  to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a  tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer said.
With  less colorful language, Gov.
Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based  companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor
