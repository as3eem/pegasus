Last night when I left the Enron Building, once again I was so very depressed thinking that another executive was taking millions of dollars away from Enron and leaving the employees to fend for ourselves.
On the way home I heard your announcement on the radio that you were not going to exercise that part of your contract.
Thank you for restoring my faith in Enron.
I truly appreciate the sacrifice you are making and thank you for thinking about the employees.
