Hello Greg--A belated congrats on the new post at Enron--We had, as you probably read, a sort of pool going about who would get tagged for the big desk-- Most of the emails we received offering their thoughts on the question seems to favor you--most were also fmr Enron traders and the like.
I had to chuckle about the stories that ran about you in the past few weeks--you must be tired of the tanker reference by now.
I seem to recall the last time we traded emails and calls was around the time you took over the wholesale group--most of the stories at that time were equally clever--"he should know about volitility, he used to drive a tank in germany...blah blah blah.
Anyhow, hope all is well chief, would like to do an interview at some point, for either The Desk or The Risk Desk.
Your call.
By the way, who is the nominal head of the bandwidth desk these days--hawthorne?
