Serge:  Sorry to take so long to respond.
A few things:  (1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about?
Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility?
(2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set up  a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit  goup to  react.
I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you.
Please let me know if you have any other questions.
