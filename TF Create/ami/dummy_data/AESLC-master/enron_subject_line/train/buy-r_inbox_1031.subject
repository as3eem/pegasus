I have been advised that the board meeting will most likely last until 4:30 p.m.
I have adjusted the departure from White Plaines to 4:45 p.m.; which will have you arriving into Houston at approximately 7:00 p.m.  A hot dinner aboard the plane has been arranged.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
