Gerald, As discussed yesterday, we are targeting to deliver an LOI to Oakhill Pipeline this Thursday morning.
Please review the attached LOI Draft and provide any comments.
Items in red are still being worked and will be confirmed by tomorrow afternoon.
Please contact me with any questions.
Thanks, Lisa Druzbik
