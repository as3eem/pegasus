If your TERMINAL SERVER H: drive is located in Houston, Please let me know ASAP.
You will know if it is by signing on to a terminal Server session and then double clicking on My Computer and then select the H: Drive.
If it says anything like nahou then you are located in Houston.
If it says napdx then you are located in Portland.
The only ones I need to know about is if you are located in Houston.
Thank you for your time.
