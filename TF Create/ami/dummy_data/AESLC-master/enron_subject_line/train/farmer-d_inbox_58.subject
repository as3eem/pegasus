Hi, Hope you are doing something productive  these days.
Are you guys ready for Santa yet?
I'm sure the boys  are.
Looks like the "Cornboys" had a good  weekend what with the Heisman and a trip to the Rose Bowl.
We Huskers are  becoming so spoiled.
Another chance at a National Championship -------------  God, I love it.
