Dan,   ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines  (listed below).
Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the  majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to  HPL.
Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.
What is the process  used to accomlish this?
We would like to get this set up as soon as we can.
Thanks.
