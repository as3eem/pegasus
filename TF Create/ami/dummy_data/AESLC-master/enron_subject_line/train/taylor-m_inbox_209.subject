Hi Mark,  I'm fairly flexible on my housing so let me know if there would be a closer place to stay in relationship to our dinner spot.
I'm thinking of staying out by Hobby Airport just off of 45.
I should finish my meeting with Bill Winslade (out in Friendswood) around 5:30 and be ready to meet you for dinner.
I can drive into the city if you would like.
The next morning I will travel to the Petroleum club to meet Bob Ardell for a early lunch and then fly to Dallas for visits.
Thanks,
