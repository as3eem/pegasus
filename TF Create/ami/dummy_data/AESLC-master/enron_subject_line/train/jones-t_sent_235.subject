Scott,  Can you pass on Mary Solmonson's memo to the appropriate London lawyer  responsible for Norway power contracts.
Mary is the head of Global Contracts  here in Houston, and Phillipe Travis works for Mary, and just went over to  London to work on getting systems in place for Global Contracts in London.
Thanks for your help!
