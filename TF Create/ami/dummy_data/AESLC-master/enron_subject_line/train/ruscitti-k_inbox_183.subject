Kamp,  I think you have to give up on your dream of being a game show host.
You certainly have the teethy smile,  but you display too much confidence that you are  the only one with the Top-Secret answers.
You are the weakest link.
The answers:  Haal Newhouser  - Pitcher  Yoggie Berra  -  Catcher  Jimmie Fox  - first base           Alos,  Frank Thomas  Ernie Banks  - SS  Joe Morgan  - 2nd base  Mike Schmidt  - 3-B  Mickey Mantle - outfield  Roger Marris -  Outfield  Dale Murphy  - OF         Barry bonds  - OF  ***Rich Kampman  (4 Time Winner)  -  S.F  Short-Fielder.
M.L.S.
(Major League Softball)  *** I don't think this would count,  although the Short-Fielder is another position.
And Kamp did play the position with class     Please refer to for proof.
