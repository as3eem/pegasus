Rick,  I am writing in regards to a training seminar I am developing on enterprise risk management for the power/energy sector.
I am inviting speakers for the course and would very much like for you to participate as an instructor.
Our training seminars are structured as interactive workshops.
We limit the audience to about 20 people and bring in 2-3 instructors to facilitate the course - generally speakers present for half-day sessions.
I'm attaching a draft of topics that could be covered.
I will follow up with more details but please let me know if you have an initial interest in participating.
