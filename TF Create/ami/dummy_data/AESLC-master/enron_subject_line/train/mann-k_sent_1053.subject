Stuart,  Kay's venting for the day:  Is it nitpicking to expect outside counsel to (1) make sure the option  agreement is signed AND acknowledged (2) ascertain whether the thing has the  dates filled in, and (3) makes sure that the legal description is included?
Ok, maybe I'm whining, but I think Mark should know that we are having  problems.
Have you mentioned anything to him?
