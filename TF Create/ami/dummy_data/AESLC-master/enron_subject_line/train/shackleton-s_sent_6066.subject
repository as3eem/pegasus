Tanya:  Bob Crane did a deal with the Canadian party identified below.
Sounds like  he originally told our FX trader that the parties would be EGM (actually ENA)  and Enron Industrial Markets ("EIM").
In the end, EIM was not the correct  party but the Canadian party was the correct party.
Is this trade between ENA and Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona authorized by  credit?
Is the company eligible?
Please let me know what you think.
Thanks.
