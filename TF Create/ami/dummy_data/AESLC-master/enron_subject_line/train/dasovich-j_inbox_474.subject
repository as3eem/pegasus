Dear All,   Attached to this message is the agenda outline for our meeting in Houton TX on Wednesday, October 10 beginning at 8 AM.
I have arranged with Linda Noske for a continental breakfast to be available so we can get started promptly at 8AM and as Christi has noted, lunch will also be provided.
Any questions, please contact me.
Kind Regards,
