Elizabeth:  Rick asked me to contact you regarding PAC checks.
If we are still making contributions, I would like to request a check for my brother City Council member Carroll Robinson.
He is running in the Democratic primary for the 25th Congressional District to replace Ken Bensten, who is running for the US Senate.
Please advise.
