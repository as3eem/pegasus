October 30, 2001     Ken,   With every article I read concerning Enron, I think  of you and the obstacles you surmounted in the mid-80s.
If you need  help in the Public Affairs arena, my timing is perfect.
Peyton and I,  within the last month, moved into our new home in Santa Fe.
I am between  commitments to allow time to get settled in the new place.
I will be happy to  come to Houston if I can assist you in any way.
Hang tough!
Every good Wish,   Nancy
