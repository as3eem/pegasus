Michelle:  I've been meaning to call you.
I understand that there are a number of issues regarding paying European employees' expenses.
My schedule is pretty filled up for Thursday.
If none of my meetings run over, then I have a break between noon and 1:00 or 2:00 and 3:00.
Or I could discuss these issues after 8:00 p.m.  Let me know when you would like to talk and if you continue to have issues in this regard.
Thanks - Sylvia
