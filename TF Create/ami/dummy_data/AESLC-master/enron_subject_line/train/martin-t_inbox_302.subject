FYI  	I'm trying to sell 10,000/d off Blk Marlin into Carbide for Nov & Dec 01.
Jody was a pass on HSC - $0.03 because of other gas he has flowing 	which he now indicates is showing up at HSC - $0.04 to $0.05.
Nelson hasn't confirmed price to me but the best I've heard from him was 	a HSC - $0.04 and he wanted to better Spinniker's price.
Our last shot for Nov & Dec is Monday.
After that, we have a shot at gas that comes up Jan 01 at TX City.
Jody still wants to see a delivered price off of MOPS and he seems to  	be expecting HSC - $0.10 to $0.12 based on gas he's buying at 	El Paso Blessing.
