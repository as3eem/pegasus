We are contemplating selling the Blue Dog turbines to NorthWestern.
I've  been out of town with a sick dad, so I'm not clear who has been in the loop  and who hasn't.
However, since these are TurboPark turbines, I wanted to  make sure you are aware of the deal.
It is the commercial teams desire to  enter into an exclusivity arrangement as soon as possible.
Sorry for the short notice - today is the first day I've been able to pick up  my email.
