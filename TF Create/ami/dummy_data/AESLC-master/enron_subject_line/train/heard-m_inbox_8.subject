Dear Ms. Heard,  	On behalf of my colleague Michael Mask, I attach a draft ISDA Schedule and a draft Credit Support Annex for your review.
The terms are subject to CSFB's review of the draft Enron Guarantee that I believe Lissa Rosenthal has discussed with you.
Please forward this Guarantee, along with any comments you may have to the attached, to Michael (212-538-2313) or me.
(Although Michael is negotiating this transaction, he will be out of the office for the next week and I will be the contact in the interim.)
Thank you,

@subject
