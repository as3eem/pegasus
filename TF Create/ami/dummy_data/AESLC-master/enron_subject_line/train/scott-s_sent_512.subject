Agustin,  I am trying to confirm the counterparty on one of your deals so that it can  be properly assigned in TAGG.
The ticket for the deal in question reads  Barcel Mexico.
However, I spoke recently with Beatrice Reyna who informed me  that you believed the counterparty to be one of the Bimbo companies.
If you  wouldn't mind looking into this and getting back to me with the correct  counterparty name it would be much appreciated.
Thanks,
