Hello family and  friends.
I just received this message from, Youri, a friend of mine in  Europe.
He explains that this photo was apparently taken by a tourist  moments before the terrorist airline crash into the World Trade Center and that  the film/camera was found in the ruble and obviously developed.
If this is  real... can you imagine!!!!!!!!!
Totally disturbing, totally  unreal.
