Attached for your review and comments is Enron's Answer to Motion for Partial Summary Disposition by the Texas, New Mexico and Arizona full-requirements shippers in the complaint proceeding that they filed in July (RP01-486).
The shippers have asked the Commission to (a) summarily determine that El Paso's mainline capacity is not adequate to serve its existing firm customers and (b) expeditiously establish a remedy phase in this proceeding.
Enron's answer reiterates the comments it filed in the original proceeding, namely that the Commission should consolidate this proceeding with the complaint filed in RP01-484 by the Joint Complainants (producers, California LDCs) which also deals with issues of adequacy of capacity.
We also reiterate and emphasize our original proposal that the Commission require El Paso to immediately give existing firm shippers the opportunity to turn back capacity they no longer need as one means of making additional capacity available to those who need more.
You do not need to respond, but if you desire to, please get any comments back to me or Leslie by noon tomorrow.
Thanks.
