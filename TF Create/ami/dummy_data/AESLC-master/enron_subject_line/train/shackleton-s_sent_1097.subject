Pablo:  I am forwarding this message that I send to Patricia last week.
She  may be out of town or otherwise engaged.
Would it be possible for you (or  someone else in the firm) to respond to my two questions?
I only need a  short explanation.
If you need to reach me, my telephone is (713) 853-5620  and my fax is (713) 646-3490.
Thank you for your assistance.
Regards.
Sara
