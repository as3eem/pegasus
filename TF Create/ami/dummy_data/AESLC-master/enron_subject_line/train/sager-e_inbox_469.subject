I spoke to Elizabeth Sager today and she is on-board for everyone visiting with the relevant attorney to walk through the details of each contract and fill out the power contract grid and one-page summary.
Please make every effort to knock these out by Friday such that we can quickly begin prioritizing and move to the next stage.
The attorneys should have the grid and one page summary sheet.
Thanks,
