Michelle: Thanks for taking a look at this memo that Andre Sarasin of Papiers Stadacona would like to send out to his employees today.
Please note that this will be issued in French, so this English translation is not perfect...but it least it gets the main message across.
Please let me know what you think--both Peter and Cheryl have approved this.
