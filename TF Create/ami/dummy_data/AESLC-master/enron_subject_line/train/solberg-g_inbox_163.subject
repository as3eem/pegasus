Group,  We have developed a process for tiering our bids and should do so going forward.
Please use appropriate dollar and mw values.
Below is JUST an example.
When tiering, the top numbers (mw values) must be monotonically increasing and the last two numbers on the bottom of your tier ($ values) must be the same.
