Dear Vince,  I was wondering whether in addition to your talk on market and credit risk at EPRM you would be interested in participating in the panel debate at the beginning of day two?
The panel will be a senior-level debate on the future of the US power markets and I thought this might be something you would be interested in speaking on.
I have reattached an up-to-date version of the agenda.
Please let me know what you think.
Best wishes,
