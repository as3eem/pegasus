Commissioner Wood has issued extensive questions on direct access, continuing his harassment of ESPs.
He raises the issues of moving the termination date back from September 20 and supposed cost shifting.
He also asks for copies of contracts with customers and extensive information about those contracts.
Comments are due Nov 2 with replies due Nov 8.
We plan to respond aggressively through our coalition, Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM).
We WILL NOT be providing any contract information.
