With Aleck Dadson's recent departure, I am pleased to announce that Rob Hemstock will immediately assume a leadership role on behalf of Government Affairs for Enron Canada.
Rob will be working very closely in this capacity with Rob Milnthorp as well as myself and others.
Please join me in congratulating Rob on his new responsibilities.
