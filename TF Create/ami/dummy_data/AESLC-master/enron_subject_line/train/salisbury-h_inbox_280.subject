Rain or shine, we will be having our picture taken for this year's West Power Trading customer mailing tomorrow.
Please join us at the Salmon Street fountain steps at 1 pm.
If it is raining, our photo will be taken on the bridge level, in the southeast corner by the number Two World Trade Center building.
Let me know if you have any questions!
Thanks,

Group Photo Tomorrow, 11/15, at 1 pm
