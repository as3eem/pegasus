Hey guys.
There is a new Alumni search database that was added to the Mass Delta homepage.
It'll take 5 minutes to enter your info so anyone from the chapter can search for anyone else.
Please take the time to enter your info.
It asks for some historical info to log in-if you can't remember and have to ask, don't bother showing up at Car Rallye because you will be bowled.
