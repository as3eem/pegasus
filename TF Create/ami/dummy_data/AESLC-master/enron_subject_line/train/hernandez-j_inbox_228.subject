For the last two nights, the hourly desk night crew was unable to view/print the scheduling activity report (SAR) for the northeast hourly book.
This report provides detail as to whether or not the book is flat net megawatts for the day.
We were able to view and print the SAR report for the remaining hourly books (ERCOT, southeast, midwest).
Why is this problem persisting?
Please investigate this to rectify this situation.
Thanks.
