Sally -   Thanks for your call.
Attached is the Gas Risk data Jeff provided me today.
I may not have mentioned it in our conversation, but Louise is also looking for a brief explanation as to why a person should be nominated for a promotion.
For any promotions you propose, please develop a few bullets to explain the reasons for this action.
Please call if you or Bob have any questions.
Thanks - Tana
