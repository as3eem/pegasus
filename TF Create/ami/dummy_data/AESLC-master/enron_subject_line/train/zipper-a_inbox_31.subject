One of our Arkansas pilots died this week He had signed up in August of 2001 but had not flown a mission for us yet.
Details on the memorial forthcoming.
Below is correspondence regarding the crash.
Be careful out there.
Beth,    According to news reports this morning Dr. Jim Arnold and his wife were killed yesterday in the crash of their Cessna Conquest near Arkansas City, KS, leaving two boys ages 5 and 7.
That will also effectively remove Stan Sence from the pilot list as he flew Dr. Arnold's other airplane.
