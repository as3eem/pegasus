Jeff,  Jim and I spoke today about having Enron participate separately in this proceeding -- responding to the utilities' plans to be filed today.
I believe that AReM will take a strong position and will incorporate any comments we have.
I don't see anything we can gain by paying for a separate filing under Enron's name.
Jim agreed.
Jim asked that you call him if you have major concerns with this approach.
