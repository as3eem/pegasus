Please read the following message from Kathie Grabstald and Michelle Vitrella  in Public Relations.
The Weekly Electronic Newsletter is a project that Mark  Frevert requested and it is important that Enron Global Markets be  responsive  when we are asked for information from our business units.
Please pass along to Kathie and Michelle the name of a contact person in your  group that will be responsible for providing updates for the weekly  newsletter.
Kathie has assured me that the person providing the information  is not required to do the actual writing, but provide bullet points which she  will then prepare in paragraph form.
Michelle will send a reminder message  to the contact person when the updates are needed.
Thank you for your assistance with this project.
