As Frank indicated below, below is a new bandwidth product being introduced  online.
Frequently, if we have a new product and it is close enough in  character to another product, we just mirror the approvals we have already  given to the mirrored product.
Does this strategy work for you, or are there  any issues we are unfamiliar with that would require us to review this  product in a totally different manner?
