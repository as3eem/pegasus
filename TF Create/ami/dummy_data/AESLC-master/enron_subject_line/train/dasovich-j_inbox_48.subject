Dear EvMBA Students,  Please remember to stop by the office and fill out your address update  form.
Even if your information has not changed we would still like you to  fill it out.
If you do not do so, we will not be able to put your  information in the student directory (which will be available soon).
Once  again, if you do not fill out the form we will assume that you do not want  to be included in the directory.
I hope you are having a great semester so far.
Thanks,
