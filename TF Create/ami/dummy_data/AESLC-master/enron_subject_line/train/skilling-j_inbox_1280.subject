Brothers,     Linda Grumbles just informed me that John is not recovering the way the Drs.
want him to and that the same artery may be blocked again, or even closed.
In other words, the first catheter treatment didn't pan out.
He goes back in for another one, this time probably installing a stint in the artery to keep it open, next week on Sept. 14.
His email address has changed and it's now jgrumbles76@hotmail.com.
I'm certain he and Linda would appreciate your keeping them in your prayers.
Yours in -kai-,
