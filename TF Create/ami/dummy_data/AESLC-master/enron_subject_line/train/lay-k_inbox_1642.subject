Dear Dr. Lay:  As a stockholder, I am as upset as you, most Enron employees and other co-shareholders are given Enron's recent performance due to questionable management by scrupulous officers at Enron.
As an ex-employee, I have seen many signs of a major collapse, given the fact that Enron's values (such as Respect, Integrity, Communicatons and Excellence) were simply not followed by Enron's officers and senior members of management.
There are examples, such as in Panama, Palestine, and the Dominican Republic.
One bad deal after the other with questionable economics and accounting to make each deal look good for the personal benefit of one individual in charge.
It is about time that you get rid of these individuals and bring Enron back to what you have built over the years to be a successful company.
Regards,
