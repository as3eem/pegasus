Joe:  We need to shape three (3) Central curves and could use your help.
P1		P2 PAN-TX-OK  TRUNKL-TX  WNG-TOK  You have any suggestions as to which point(s) we could use as a primary curve?
Two would be helpful for each  FYI - For NGPL (STX), I ended up using HSC rather than Tennessee after looking at basis differentials against both points.
Thanks.
