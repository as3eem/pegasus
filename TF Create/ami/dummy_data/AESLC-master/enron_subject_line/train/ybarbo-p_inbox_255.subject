A few of you have been notified by accounting that you have been or will be removed from direct pay for American Express.
For those who haven't, you will be taken off immediately, per Eric Gonzales.
To see if you have already been removed from direct pay, please call Cheryl Slone (68347).
If you have already been removed, you may need to pay the last American Express bill.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
