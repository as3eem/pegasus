Entergy filed proposed revisions to its pro forma OATT relating to Ancillary Services Schedules Nos.
3, 4, 5 and 6, proposed to be effective August 1, 2001.
Entergy's basic premise is that the pro forma tariff and ancillary services established as part of Entergy's Open Access Transmission Tariff settlement in Docket No.
ER95-112 should be changed.
Entergy states that current charges are based on the amount of energy transmitted by Entergy without regard to the amount of capacity and energy Entergy must maintain in order to provide these services, and that these charges should be capacity-based rather than energy-based.
EPMI -- among several other parties -- protested the filing.
