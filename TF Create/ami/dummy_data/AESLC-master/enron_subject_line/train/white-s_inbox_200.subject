Will,  I am attaching a list of the deals (both physical and financial) which simply need a desk name change to East or West Bankrupt, whichever is relevant.
My list details the deal #, counterparty full name and the termination date.
Let me know if this makes sense, and as always, thank you so much for your help!
Casey
