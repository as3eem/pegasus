I just got another call from Sandy Steffen, and she would like, if possible,  to resolve any contract issues with have with each of the product groups, so  they can be set up to trade by tomorrow.
She also expressed an interest  espectially today  in NATURAL GAS.
After talking to her can you let me know  under what contract and/or limitations they can trade.
Thanks  It appears she has only heard back from the online team
