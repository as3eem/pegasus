Chris,  I met with Phillip yesterday, and he had a few more items to add to his list  of objectives for me.
For your information, the attached table provides the  additional items.
Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.
Also, the following e-mail from Mike Grigsby relates to the Socal sendout  model objective.
Also for your information, I will be running Randy Gay's  EOL product (Keystone Cash) next week and will be covering for Tori K during  her maternity leave.
I don't expect these activities to interfere with my  fundy responsibilities.
Mat
