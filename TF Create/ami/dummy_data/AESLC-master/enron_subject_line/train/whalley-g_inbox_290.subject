Knowledge Management (KM) Systems Changing with the Demands of Oil & Gas Industry; Houston Workshop Examines New Paradigm  Houston, Texas (November 7, 2001) A more practical KM model is emerging for the oil and gas industry that catalogs and networks a company's experience rather than documenting its practices.
Under this model, a firm's collective experience and its members' specialized knowledge and credentials are cataloged to allow users to quickly and efficiently leverage the extended organization.
This approach helps with two macro trends in oil and gas: (1) the trend towards core competency development, and (2) the creation of an extended workforce as a large proportion of management reach retirement.
Management are able to create a dynamic network of experts and resources that spread across many partnering organizations as well as semi-retired employees.
Entitled "Creating Successful Knowledge Management (KM) Systems: Communicating Experience Rather than Documenting Practices," a workshop on December 4, 2001 at Houston's George R. Brown Convention Center will present this new KM approach in advance of the Interactive Energy conference and exhibition.

"The second most important element is capturing learning rather that abstract procedures or static information."
