Dear Kathy,  I have checked your Terminal Server.
The setting is ready for UBS.
I also copy some pure libary file or application without Enron records back to the system and your Terminal Server.
The Excel Version Position manager is ready for used.
DprAutomation has been changed.
The changes are on the production files.
Please let us know if there is any problem..
Thank you!
