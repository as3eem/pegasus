Mr. Lay, Enron has been very good to our contract company.
We have very little expectation of being paid but we love this company as much as you do.
We work in your corporate records with a great group of people and I feel we are needed there at this time.
We have so much faith in you and we know you will pull Enron through this tumultuous time.
This is meant to be a note of encouragement for a man we all admire very much.
You've done it before.
You can do it again.
