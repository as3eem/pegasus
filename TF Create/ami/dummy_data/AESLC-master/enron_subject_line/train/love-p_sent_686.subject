Please replace your physical tabs in your P&L to the file format attached= =20 below.
This should eliminate interdesk variances.
You will need to add th= e=20 MTM information and any transport/flash to actual items that you currently= =20 may have on your physical tab.
I would suggest doing this tomorrow morning= =20 when you roll your P&L.
Shout with any questions.
Thanks.
