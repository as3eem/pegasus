We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430.
The volume is 34,248  dts and the price is $2.22.
I did not Bill CES for this deal.
According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR the  gas and we paid it back in January.
Tom said CES was going to pay us for  this.
Should I bill the Retail group for this?
It looks more like a  wholesale transaction.
