Beginning with the Timely cycle for gas day October 21, 2001, and until further notice, the capacity will be restated to 1,920 MMcf/d through Station 8, which approximates 2,050 MMcf/d at Kingsgate.
Off-line deliveries upstream of Station 8 and receipts downstream of Station 8 will not be affected.
