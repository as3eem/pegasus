Alex -  Attached is a revised version of the amendment letter for the Electronic Trading Agreement.
I have added the proposed language regarding punitive damages as a new subsection to Section 4.
Please take a look at the attached and advise accordingly.
If this is acceptable, I will finalize the agreement, get it signed and have it forwarded to you for counter-signature by DB.
Thanks for the assistane.
Glad to hear that you and your co-workers are okay in the wake of recent events.
Mark
