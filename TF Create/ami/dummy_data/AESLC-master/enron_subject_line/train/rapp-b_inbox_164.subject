Bill, please coordinate TW's response to the questions set forth in the Order.
We probably ought to think about how we communicate with USGT regarding responses.
I plan to talk with Mary Kay and Kilmer regarding regulatory support.
Although I don't want to get involved with a territory dispute, I think it would be smart for MKM's group to handle for consistency.
That's going to be my recommendation to them.
Thanks again for your help yesterday.
Greg
