Mike,  Following request has been made for a number of people.
The access requested is: o:\research\power meteorology\weather temperatures -  Read/Write  Data Approval  Grant    This is what I wrote, denying the request:  The reason for the rejection has been communicated  several times.
The person who requested the access does not want it any more.
Granting both  read/write access could threaten the integrity of the data.
Any comments?
Vince
