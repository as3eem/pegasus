Guys, the project should be charged market based rates and ENA is not in the  business of subsidizing international projects.
This is particularily the  case if we are not going to hold a continued interest in the project.
However, if we can not reach a term O&M agreement please maintain the  optionality in the project by managing the facility on a direct bill basis to  APACHI until they find an alternative provider.
Do not in any event abandon  any assets at any time.
