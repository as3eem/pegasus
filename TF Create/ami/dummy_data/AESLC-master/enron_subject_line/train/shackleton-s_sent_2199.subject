John:  The Duke issue has arisen once again in connection with the  settlements group.
Did you ever resolve the issue?
Apparently, two (2) identical trades were executed online on 9/11/00, one at  1:14 pm and the second at 1:28 pm.
Duke agrees wtih the first trade but not  the second.
Please bring me up to date.
Thanks.
Sara
