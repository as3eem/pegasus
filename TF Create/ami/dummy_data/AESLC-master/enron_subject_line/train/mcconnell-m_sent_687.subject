Jeff,  Steve Horn is pushing for us to speak at this conference in Aspen.
I told  him that I am not available but it does look good and it is in a nice place -  also the speakers are first rate.
What do you think?
If you are interested  please let Steve know.
I told him that I thought everyone was busy.
Mike
