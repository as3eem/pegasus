See the new versions of the netting agreement forms below.
All that has been done is to move the Force Majeure concept to paragraph 2(a) from 14(b).
This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.
In certain instances if you want to "kill" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.
The docs remain at v1 (version 1).
