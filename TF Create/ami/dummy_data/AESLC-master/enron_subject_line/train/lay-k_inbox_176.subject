Ken,  After numerous efforts to secure an audience with President Fox, we have been successful in scheduling a lunch with him on the 27th of June.
In addition to our usual reasons for taking this very important one-day trip, I have been advised by Presidencia (equivalent for our "West Wing") that during this face-to-face meeting, we would have the appropriate opportunity to invite President Fox to visit Houston.
I have just received written confirmation of the 2:30 p.m. luncheon meeting.
I will be going to appropriate GHP Boardmembers and major investors to determine who would be available to participate.
I wanted to give my leadership heads up and request any thoughts or ideas that you may have on this subject matter as well as to determine your availability.
Regards,
