Hey,  I keep hearing negative things about Lord of the Rings.
Any desire to see In the Bedroom.
It's a thriller with Sissy Spacek.
I've heard good things about it.
Or The Shipping News with Kevin Spacey.
This is a drama.
I think I'd prefer the thriller myself.
In the Bedroom is playing at the Edwards near you at 1:30pm.
What do you think?
