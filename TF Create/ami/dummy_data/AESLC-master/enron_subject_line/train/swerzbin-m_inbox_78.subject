First off Happy New Year's to all you guys!
Most of you already have the  dates and other information about our Whistler trip this year but I wanted  to make sure you had all the details for this year's extravaganza.
For  those of you that went last year you know the drill.
I pay for  accomodations and meals (and we will eat at some nice places!).
You  arrange your own transportation, lift tickets and ski rental (all of which  can be done on arrival and cost under 150 US dollars).
Here are the details:  Dates:   Jan 31st thru Feb. 3
