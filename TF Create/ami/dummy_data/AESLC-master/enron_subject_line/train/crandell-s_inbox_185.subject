Sean, Enclosed is a proposed methodology for the Dow Jones Hourly Index.
Our longer term goal is to have this information posted to a website and available on an hourly basis, with perhaps a 2 or so hour delay.
That will take longer to implement and some firms have expressed reservation with receiving the information too early.
Presently, our goal is to have this information available to traders via email by 5:00 a.m. PT.
This is preliminary and your thoughts and comments would be appreciated.
Cheers,
