November 16, 2001  Dear Enron Users:  Due to a severe storm which hit central Texas last evening CYNET is experiencing a temporary service interruption of the assigned telephone numbers of it's Inbound Fax-2-Email Service.
Our local loop carrier has advised us they are aware of the situation  and they are working to restore this connectivity.
While CYNET maintains back-up facilities for its Fax-2-Email services the problem we are faced with is that we can not place the same user telephone number within two different facilities at the same time.
Our technical team is working on future recommendations in the form of having individual back-up numbers in the event of this type of outage.
We sincerely do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and your users and expect to have this service restored as soon as possible.
Sincerely,

@subject
