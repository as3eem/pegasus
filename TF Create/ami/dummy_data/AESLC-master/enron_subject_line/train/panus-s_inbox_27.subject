Henry -  Attached is a draft of the proposed confidentiality agreement for work to be pursued with Enron Net Works.
I sincerely apologize for the delay in forwarding this document to SunGard for review.
It is possible that a few additional comments will need to be added once I have discussed the document further with key business personnel.
Please review the attached at your convenience and also forward, as necessary, to anyone else in your organization who is required to review and approve agreements of this nature.
Thanks for your patience.
