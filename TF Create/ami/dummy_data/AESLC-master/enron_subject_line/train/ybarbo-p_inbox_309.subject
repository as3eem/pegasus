Captain Bentzr?d-  Please leave a heel of LNG on board the vessel sufficient to reach the next loading in Qalhat on July 5 in load ready condition.
Please estimate the volume you will require and revert, keeping in mind that we would like to unload as much as possible on June 9 at Lake Charles within the parameters outlined above.
Thanks and regards,
