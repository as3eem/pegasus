Vince-  Are you going over to the new building right away?
The reason I ask is on the trading floor the workspaces are very small, and there is no room whatsoever for books (eg, econometrics texts).
I think this revives the issue of a library.
We used to have a wonderful one, then it went away.
I was wondering if you could keep a thought in the back of your mind in terms of a place where people could go to find and read good textbooks.
Thank you,
