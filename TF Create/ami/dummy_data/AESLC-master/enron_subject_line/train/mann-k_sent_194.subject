Hi Gregg,  Here is a new draft which incorporates comments that Boyd and I have made.
I  haven't reviewed this version yet, but I wanted to get it to you asap.
I  would like to look at this draft before it goes to Peoples, and I'll give it  priority for tomorrow am.
I spoke with Dave Gorde (RAC).
He is prepared to discuss line of credit/DASH  at your convenience, although tomorrow he is tied up with PRC.
I'll go ahead and get a draft of a "simple" revolving line of credit doc  started, unless you think otherwise.
Kay
