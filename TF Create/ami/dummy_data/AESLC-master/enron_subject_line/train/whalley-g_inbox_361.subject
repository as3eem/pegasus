We sleeeved some of the P Plus with DYN today.
That's the good news.
The bad news, they charged us 10 cents /bbl versus 3-4 cents that we got from others.
To add insult they wanted 20-25 cents for size.
Understand 2 seperate entities but they should not take advantage of any info they have to take advantage of us.
Don said the trader was told to quote the higher numbers, it was not his decision.
