Sally -   I have talked with Jeff Gossett and Bob Superty regarding possible promotions in their groups, but have not talked to any other group leaders.
Please let me know if you would like to be the contact for any of the groups or if you would like me to get that information from group Directors.
You can reach me on my cell at 713-503-7912 and I will be working late tonight.
Thanks for your help - Tana
