Bill you may want to sit in on this if you have time.
It seems we have items  of concern that were identified during the consolidated audit at Bakersfield  which were tied into  a previous agreement with Koch for which the action  team did not know when the action items were prepared.
The action dates are  approaching and   Scott and I are having a hard time getting clearification  on how to initiate getting the the action items started due to the  responsibility of Koch for some of the items.
Ed, the attorney for EOTT,   will be requested by Lou, to notify Koch concerning their responsiblity.
If  this sounds convoluted, then you know as much as I.....
