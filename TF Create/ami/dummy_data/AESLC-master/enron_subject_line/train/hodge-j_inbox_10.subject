Don't forget to meet us tomorrow evening from 5 - 8 p.m. at the Boaka Bar downtown!
Located at 1010 Prairie, the Boaka Bar is right next door to the Mercury Room and your first drink is free!
Bring a new member with you (who pays their dues onsite) and you'll be entered into a drawing for HOUSTON TEXAN tickets!
The member who brings the most guests will win tickets to this year's HOUSTON LIVESTOCK SHOW & RODEO, so come out and bring your friends!
Also, mark your calendar for February 20th's Storage Economics Brown Bag... email Lana Moore for details at lana.moore@nesanet.org.
The next Technical Training class will be March 12-13 (Nominations thru Allocations)and Lana can help with your registration on that as well.
Have a good week, and I'll see you at the Boaka Bar!
