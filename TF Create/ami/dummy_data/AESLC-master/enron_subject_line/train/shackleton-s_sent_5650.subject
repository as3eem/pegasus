Thomas:  Attached is a redline of the Client Agreement.
I know that Gary Hickerson  will be meeting with J P Morgan early next week and would like to have this  agreed.
Please advise as to what attorney will review my comments and put me  in touch with that person today.
Please let me know if you have any  questions.
Thanks.
