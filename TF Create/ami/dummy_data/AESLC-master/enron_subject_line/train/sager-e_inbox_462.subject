Debbie and Tanya: At our group meeting this morning, the general consensus was that we should continue to send margin letters to those counterparties that have not yet terminated.
Can Harlan and I meet with you sometime this afternoon to talk about this so that we can keep track of what is being done?
Anytime after 1 works for me.
