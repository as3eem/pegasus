Mr. Lay:  I do not know who is left in EES or Corporate HR to send this to.
I was severed Oct 5 and have two severance payments due on 31 Dec and 31 Jan.  Will Enron pay these?
Since I signed a waiver not to sue Enron, can I participate in the bankruptcy proceedings if Enron does not pay?
Also, there are  quite a few previously severed employees who have questions, would you add information to the website regarding our status regarding payments etc.
Regards,
