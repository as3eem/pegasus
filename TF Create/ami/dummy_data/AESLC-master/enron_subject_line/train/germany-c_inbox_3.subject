Greetings,  I understand from a conversation with John Allocca of KeySpan that Enron intends to release back to Boston Gas the 35,679 Dth/d beginning July 1, non-recallable, through 4/1/07 (the end date of the original release to Enron).
The capacity can be posted, confirmed and awarded via our bulletin board.
Ivy can walk you through the release and it can be done in about 5 minutes.
The capacity will revert back to its original contract, Boston Gas R-420-01.
Please call me if you have any questions, or if we are in error regarding this matter.
Regards,
