Bruce,   I work with Phillip Allen in West Gas Trading and he talked to Greg Piper  about the letter attached below, and Greg told us to forward it to you.
Mr. Chase Belew and Mr. Carleson, with E*Steel, would like to meet with you  to discuss market opportunities in the global steel market.
I would like to  have Mr. Belew call you to set up a time to meet with you.
Would this be a  problem?
Please call me to discuss.
Sincerely,

@subject
