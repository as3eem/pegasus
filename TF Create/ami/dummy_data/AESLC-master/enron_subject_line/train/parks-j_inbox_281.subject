Joe, Here's the Letter Agreement.
Remember that the Letter Agreement was drafted with February 28,2002 Purchase Date so we need a dollar figure for the post-bankruptcy storage fees.
For now I have left it blank.
Any chance that Centana will accept the $308,000 fee due for 2/28 because they were the ones dragging their feet on the deal?
