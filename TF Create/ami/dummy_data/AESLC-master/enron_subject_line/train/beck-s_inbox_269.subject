As part of the HPL transition, we are reviewing imbalances on shipper contracts.
Attached below is the list and where we stand on reconcilations.
About 50% are reconciled, meaning that the counterparty agrees with our number.
Most we are waiting on information from the counterparty.
The big items are the imbalances with Duke Energy, Gulf Energy, and Tejas.
Rita and I have people working with these counterparties to get good information.
thanks
