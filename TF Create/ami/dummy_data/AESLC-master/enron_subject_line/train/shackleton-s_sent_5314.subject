Tanya:  I'd like to send our Schedule to Rabobank today since we will be off  Monday, Jan. 15 and I have been called for jury duty on Tuesday, Jan. 16.
I  will ask Angela Davis (a finance lawyer with swap experience who is helping  us out on the structured deals) to handle this for me.
I don't want to deal  with Rabobank's form of Schedule as a basis for discussion and I am told that  this deal closes Friday, Jan. 19..  A voice mail would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
Sara
