We met with Mike Deville on Friday and discussed issues surrounding ENW's cash forecast.
As a result of updated information, we would like to amend our cash forecast as shown in the attached.
The attached file has also restated salaries and related expenses to reflect Netco employees in January (as you had adjusted our file).
The file does not reflect any allocations out.
