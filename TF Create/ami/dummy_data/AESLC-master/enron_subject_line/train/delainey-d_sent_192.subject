Barbara, short of me coming up with the money, it will be next to impossible  to get this out of either the trading or origination group.
As a significant  contributor to the PAC and Enron's other adventures, I don't have the room.
Personally, I also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely  linked to specific legislation or policy.
This may not be the answer you  want; however, I am all ears if you have any ideas on raising these funds.
