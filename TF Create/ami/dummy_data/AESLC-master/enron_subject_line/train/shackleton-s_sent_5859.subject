Mark:  This is a chronic problem which I have addressed with Cheryl on more  than one occasion (hence the email of this morning).
Her priorities are not  currently with the swap group.
Also, Carol will not be a reliable backup for  structured deals since Julia's group will demand more of her time.
I don't  know what Angela's load will be like as an ongoing substitute.
Last night we  received notice of Yosemite IV and I'm hoping that Angela can cover.
Alternatively, we may need to consider Frank, Francisco or Cheryl.
