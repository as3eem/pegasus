Randy: We are still discussing internally the time period that should be specified  in the definition of Credit Support Provider.
We are not comfortable with  specifying October 2002 as the date.
What is the reason for this?
We are  trying to make this language as transaction specific as possible.
Is there  anything else that we can add to it to make it more precise?
Please call me  in the morning.
I'm in by 8:30.
Thanks.
