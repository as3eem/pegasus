Would you ever be interested in helping us with recruiting at OU?
As you are  probably aware, the analyst programs have been combined into one program, so  we are searching for top candidates to bring in for all rotations within the  analyst program.
Upcoming interviews are for summer interns.
We will be on  campus on Monday, October 30 (just after the OU - Nebraska game).
Let me  know if you are interested or if you have any questions, and we can get you  formally added to the team that is recruiting at OU.
Hope that all is going well in Chicago.
