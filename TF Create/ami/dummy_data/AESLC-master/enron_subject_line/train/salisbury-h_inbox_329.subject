Matt - Zhiyun needs to make some code changes before I can move Craig to Palo in Enpower (she needs to treat Craig as a separate region from Palo so the deal will value as a Basis Option).
Therefore I will not be changing this until she is ready.
I will keep you updated.
For the term of the UAMPS deal -  Rockies is marked flat to Palo - so I ran the Intrinsic & Extrinsic evaluation.
Once we change Craig to Palo in enpower and the correlation, we can revalue.
MTM = 1,243,586 Intrinsic = 712,104 Extrinsic = 531,483
