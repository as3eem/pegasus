Steve,  The necessary information for ENA has been placed in the attached draft as  well as a few modifications to the front page.
In addition,  I have  included  at the end of the GISB a list of Special Provisions for your  review.
Finally,  with regards to "agent",  would you fax me a copy of the Agency  Agreement,  or is it possible for the agreement to be in the name of Murphy  Exploration & Production Company.
Regards,
