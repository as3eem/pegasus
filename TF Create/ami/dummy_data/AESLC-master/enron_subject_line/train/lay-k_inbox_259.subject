Dad, The message boards look really good today.
There are one or two bad guys, but they are the shorts and everyone else is betting on stock back in the 20's before the weekend and a turnaround.
The general consensus is Enron is still a good company with good earnings and this is a great time to buy.
Love You Dad,
