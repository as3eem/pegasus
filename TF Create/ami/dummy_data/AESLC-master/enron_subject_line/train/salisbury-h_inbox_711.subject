To all who use Curve Manager,  	As you know, we have been experiencing technical difficulties with Curve Manager on Terminal Server.
As of right now, please use Curve Manager locally.
This application runs just as fast as on terminal server as it does locally.
Also, it seems to be more stable running locally.
However, if you DO experience difficulty running this application locally, please let me know ASAP.
thanks,
