I figured you'd probably see Geir before I do.
If so, would you check with  him on these deals and find out if they should be with LADWPPX or Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power?
I have a feeling it's the latter, but I'd like  to know for sure before I change the deals and eliminate the useless  counterparty name.
Thanks,
