Dad, I met with Peter Veruki at the Jones School of Administration at Rice last week and we had a great meeting.
Our timing is a little off (they want someone next spring and I want a position by Jan), but we are still talking.
There is also a position open for Director of Development of Rice University and I have contacted Malcolm Gillis and Christie Patrick happens to be meeting with him today so she is going to mention that I am interested.
There are also a couple of positions at UH which I am going to look into, so I am hopeful something good will come of all this.
Christie Patrick has been my one woman promoter, she is wonderful.
I'll keep you posted.
I love you Dad,
