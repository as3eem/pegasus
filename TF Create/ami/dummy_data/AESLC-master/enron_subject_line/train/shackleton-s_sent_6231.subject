Bill and Tanya:  I am resending this memo to you in light of what I understand is a 3-year  deal that Craig Breslau has done with MARTA (Metropolitan Area Rapid Transit  Authority).
I need to advise Mark Haedicke of the details as soon as  possible since MARTA is a public entity and we do not have an executed Master  Agreement with MARTA.
We sent a draft document to MARTA on May 11, 2001.
Until we resolve the "capacity" or "authority" issue, there is significant  legal risk attached to transactions with governmental entities.
I left a message for Jay Williams to please advise me of trade details.
