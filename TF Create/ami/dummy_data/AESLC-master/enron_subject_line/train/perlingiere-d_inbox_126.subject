Veronica, Attached is the Guaranty Amendment for Nicor Energy, L.L.C., which adds financial transactions to the existing guaranty.
Please copy Jim Hunt at Nicor (jhunt@nicor.com) on you message.
Once received from Nicor, the Amendment needs to be countersigned by ENA.
We will also need a copy for our files when fully executed.
Please call me if you have any questions.
