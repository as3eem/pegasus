there is, in effect, no monthly update to speak of.
we have heard no word whether the other parties have finalized their settlement in priniciple, but note that  there have been no filings with the court.
there also have been no communications from the court, either about a case conference or a rescheduled date for the motion hearing.
we don't see any reason to push the court, so we'll let you know more when we know more.
call or e-mail with any concerns or questions.
