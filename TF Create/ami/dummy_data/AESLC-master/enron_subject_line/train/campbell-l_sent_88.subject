John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your  attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.
During the EPA Title V  inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna  environmental person was present.
She had been asked to be there by the  EPA.
During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or  decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in  the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.
I had informed her that we were  still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future  concerning management's decision.
I would appreciate it very much if each of  you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done  and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a  proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.
