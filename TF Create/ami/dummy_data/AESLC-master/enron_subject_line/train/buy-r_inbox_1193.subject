Rick,  One thought to absorb some of the budget would be to purchase Blackberry mobile devices for some of the RAC staff.
With many of the business units migrating to the new building, it is likely to be beneficial to have continuous e-mail access when Underwriters and others in the group are away from the floor.
The cost of the units, which seem to be the technology of choice, is about $300 apiece; monthly charges are about $30.
Please let me know your opinion.
