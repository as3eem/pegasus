Mary:  Remember, this is the swap that you finally decided to go ahead and terminate  yourself.
There was much confusion about how many S.A. swaps actually  exsited (only one) and after sorting through the mess, when I asked if you  had estabished a Raptor "format for termination", you decided to do the  drafting.
Let me know if there is a problem.
