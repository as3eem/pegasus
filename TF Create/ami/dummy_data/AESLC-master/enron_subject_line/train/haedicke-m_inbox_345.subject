I would like to set up a meeting to resolve the status of the Enron NA / Enron Canada contracts.
If Enron NA is not going to perform - nor is in a position to perform - shouldn't we formally cancel these contracts?
At your convenience, please call Lucy Marshall @ 713-853-4525 to indicate a convenient time.
Wednesday PM may work well for the group.
Regards,
