As a result of the reorg announcement a couple of weeks ago, this report  should now go to Philippe Bibi (or his assistant, Peggy McCurley).
Louise is  now in the office of the chair of Enron Americas.
Philippe has assumed the   role as chairman of Enron Net Works.
Since this report is a Net Works  report, please remove Louise from the distribution list and add Philippe and  Peggy effective immediately.
Also, I would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projects/deals  section each week before distribution.
What would be the most efficient way  to get this done and into your hands in a timely way?
