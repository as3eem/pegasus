Mary Jo and I cancelled the Houston meeting due to the high level of uncertainity of Enron.
There are important items related to winter and spring Pleasant Valley gas operation to review.
I recommend a brief conference call at 10:00 Tuesday.
I will call Darron and Janet.
Mary Jo will be in my office.
<<Nov13GasMtg.doc>>  Darron, I would like to excuse NNG and continue our discussion after we discuss the above items.
