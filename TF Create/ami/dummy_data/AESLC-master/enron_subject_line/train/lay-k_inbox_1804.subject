Gentlemen,  Forgive the string of emails, but I thought a more expedient way to confirm Mr. Lay's current reported holdings would be to lay them out in a spreadsheet.
This is a list of both Mr. Lay's direct and indirect holdings at companies I understand he is either a director or executive of.
Please let me know if there are any errors, and I have one question about what Mr. Lay's indirect holdings of Compaq are.
Many thanks, and I look forward to hearing back from you by Tuesday morning (Nov. 13).
Regards,
