Ike, it is unfortunate we could not make this work yesterday; but I  understand your position.
In the interest of facilitating continuing  dialogue and perhaps giving you our view on how we analyze such positions, I  will send you our document.
I would suggest that we try to set up a follow  up meeting in early October once you have completed your work.
Regards
