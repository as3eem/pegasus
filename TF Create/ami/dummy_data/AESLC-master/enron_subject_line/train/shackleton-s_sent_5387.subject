Ed:  For purposes of this "omnibus" Transaction, Con Ed requests cross-default to  ENA's guarantor and elimination of setoff for the non-defaulting party's  affiliates.
Samantha needs a worksheet for the Transaction before she can  prepare Annex B and B-1.
We're sending tonight together with the ISDA Schedule and CSA.
Sam:  We need to use the same carve-out for setoff in Annex B-1 as in the  Schedule.
