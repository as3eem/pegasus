Dear Volunteers, I am hosting a reception for our board and committee members at my home on Thursday, June 21, 2001.
FOR FUN ONLY!
It will begin at 6:00pm.
More information will be coming to you by mail.
I look forward to seeing you there.
I promise not to be serious, or make you work, or even ask you to THINK!
