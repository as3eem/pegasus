Cooper,  I hope your move on the weekend went well.
How are you liking the new digs?
I read the "Powers report" on Enron on the weekend... basically just checking for my name.... didn't find it.
One of the highlights was the fact that, in one of the many deals with the partnerships, Enron actually bought put options on Enron stock.
I hope things go well at UBS.
My number is 213-6004.
I'll probably give you a shout re: poker sometime in Feb (not sure when, though)  Bill
