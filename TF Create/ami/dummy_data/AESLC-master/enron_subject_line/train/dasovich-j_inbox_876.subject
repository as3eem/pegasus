Assembly Member Tim Leslie is interested in sponsoring a bill which would grant air credits to prospective power plant owners in exchange for using reclaimed water.
The bill is in its infancy and none of the details have been worked out.
His office would like to know if Enron would be interested in providing technical assistance with the measure.
They approached Enron because of the Roseville plant, recognizing that Roseville already has its air credits and is already scheduled to use reclaimed water.
Thoughts?
