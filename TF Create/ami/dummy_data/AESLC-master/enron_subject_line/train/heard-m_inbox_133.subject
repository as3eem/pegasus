I thought you might be interested in knowing that effective 11/30/01, the SFA will cease to exist.
A new UK law on financial services becomes effective at that time and the SFA's regulatory powers will be transferred to the Financial Services Authority.
According to Jonathan Marsh, new FSA rules will be similar but not identical to the SFA rules.
