Hi Sally -   Just wanted to let you know that I have recently begun collaborating with an ebusiness consultant from CGI - a large Canadian systems integrator with an energy practice - on a demand-generation piece that should be published in the trades in a few months.
The slant is on the scaling systems - IT and people - and the reduction in costs brought about by mid and back office systems affected by a sharp increase in online trading in the energy sector.
Eventually, will probably be looking for some quotes and input from you or your ops people.
I'll keep you up to date.
Thanks,
