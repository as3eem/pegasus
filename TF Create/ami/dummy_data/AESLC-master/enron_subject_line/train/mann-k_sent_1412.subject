Jeff,  I don't know if our group needs anyone, but I wanted to pass this resume  along.
I worked with Carlos when I was at EECC, and I rate him highly.
He'll take on anything, has good people skills, works hard, and has a varied  transactional background.
As an added bonus, he is fluent in Spanish.
EECC is being plopped into EES, and Carlos would prefer to make the move to  ENA (or EA, whatever we are called).
He discussed this with Vicky, so she is  aware that he is checking out opportunities here.
Thanks,
