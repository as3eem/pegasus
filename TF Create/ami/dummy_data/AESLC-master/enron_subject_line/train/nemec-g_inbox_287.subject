Gerald, I have attached a term sheet that I would like you to review.
As I mentioned we need to determine which contract we will use for these deals, (dedicated reserves or enfolio).
In addition, we need to send renegotiation letters to several of the parties.
If you need the list Theresa can provide it.
Let me know your thoughts as soon as you can.
Mark
