Good Afternoon,  I would like to find out where we stand on a year-end market adjustment for Donald to match what he has been offered by BPA.
He is struggling and I would like to give him some kind of hope.
I would also like your opinion on whether you think it would be more beneficial for him to stay in the Specialist pool or to try for the Sr.
Specialist pool.
Thanks,
