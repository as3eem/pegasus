Joe, I would appreciate a quick call by you to Larry to ensure that his  organization is focused to get these plants over the goal line ASAP.
We  still have technical issues with the vendor that need to be addressed.
I  believe EE&CC is working the issues; however, a phone call from you to  emphasize the importance to Enron will add extra encouragement.
Thanks.
Regards
