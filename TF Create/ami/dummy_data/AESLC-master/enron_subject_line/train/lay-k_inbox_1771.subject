Dear Ken,   I am forwarding to you a copy of a second letter that you  and Dean Powers will be receiving later today from the AFL-CIO and the  Amalgamated Bank.
This letter will also be released to the press.
It  addresses the AFL-CIO's and the Bank's concern that board  procedures be adopted that would help ensure comprehensive disclosure to  shareholders in light of a possible upcoming transaction involving  Enron.
If you, Dean Powers, or your staffs would like to discuss the  ideas in the letter or our thoughts about possible additions to the Enron board  please do not hesitate to contact me or my colleague Bill  Patterson.
Sincerely,

@subject
