Hi Evening MBA students,  The Evening MBA office will be closed for the holidays until Wednesday,  January 2.
We mailed out grade letters this morning.
If you were registered in E278  Deals or E295 Entrepreneurship, those grades will be available the first  week in January and we'll send out updated grade letters at that time.
Happy New Year!
Eric, Jane, Josh, Julie, Meg, Natalie, Seung & TJ
