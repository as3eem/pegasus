Dear Ken:  We have very serious offers out to two young - but very highly regarded - economists doing work in areas of interest to Enron.
(Please see enclosed.)
Hendricks is being recruited for one of the Lay family chairs.
Rust, now at Yale, is being recruited for our new university-wide Center in Computational Economics and Finance.
His work is likely to be of considerable interest to Enron.
