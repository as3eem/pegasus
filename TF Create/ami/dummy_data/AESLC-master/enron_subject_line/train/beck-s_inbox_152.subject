Sally,  As we briefly discussed yesterday - can we chat about identifying ENW resources for each of the Business Units in Jim's world.
Basically in 3 groups - IT Infrastructure, IT Systems Development/Maintainence and Operations Spport.
I'm trying to compile a overall Headcount Summary - by Business Unit.
Both bodies & $.
We also need to touch base on the 3/4 EBS move planning stuff.
