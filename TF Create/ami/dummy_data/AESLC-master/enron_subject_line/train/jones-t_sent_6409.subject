I told Paul Radous, the Credit guy that you had already said that these guys  could not trade physical power because they do not have a power marketing  license.
It perhaps might be possible for them to purchase US power only.
If they want to enter into power transactions he is going to need to get you  a name and phone number of someone at Engage that you can talk to to get  evidence of their power marketing license.
