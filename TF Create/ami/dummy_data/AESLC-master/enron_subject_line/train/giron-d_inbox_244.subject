How does Thursday the 18th sound to everybody?
I think it works for everybody except Todd, who I didn't hear from, which may mean he's out of town.
I'm flexible on time & place, but Giron's on the south side, Todd's by the Park shops (I think) and the rest are up north, so a central location would probably be best.
Let me know what you think and I'll coordinate or just reply to all and we'll work it out amongst ourselves.

Mother and daughter are doing fine.
