The Online Trading IT people have sent us a revised version of the long  descriptions and a document spelling out the "rules" for how they are put  together.
Louise is asking for our final comments by close of business on  next Wednesday (August 18th).
Since I will be out of town then, please  forward your comments and/or approvals directly to Mark Dilworth.
Questions  can be directed to Mark Dilworth, Marcello Romano or Louise Kitchen, all on  the online trading team.
