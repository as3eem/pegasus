Dear Lance:   As a follow-up to my prior e-mail, please find attached more detailed information about our telecommunications practice, as well as biographical information for several of our telecomm attorneys.
This is an area where we really do have unique expertise and experience, and I hope we can talk to you about being involved in the disposition of Enron Broadband.
Please give me a call if you get the chance.
My direct line is (713) 226-1143.
