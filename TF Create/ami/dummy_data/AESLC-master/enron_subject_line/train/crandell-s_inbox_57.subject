Donald,  I've basically just taken the paths apart that were scheduled for the 2nd and moved them down.
The only new thing is airproducts comes back into play on Thursday, a flat 6 mw.
at the midc.
Sean has been adjusting the california stuff daily, and maybe moving more midc to cob or visa versa to avoid so much going to cali in case of congestion.
If you have any questions, or if things get crazy, please don't hesitate to call me, I can come in if needed.
Otherwise, I'll plan on seeing you on the 7th.
