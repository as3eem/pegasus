Bryan,  I shall  call you later today when I have a chance to read the message from  Ben.
I wanted to ask you for a favor (on a very short notice).
We are talking to  the Wharton School about setting up a relationship with them and getting involved in one or  more  research projects with them.
One of the potential  topics is emerging technologies.
The Wharton offers  a  symposium in Paris on June 10  on High Tech Acquisitions  and it would make a lot of sense if you (or somebody from London you could identify) could attend and help us to  evaluate the usefulness of this project.
I am enclosing the message from the person in Wharton running this program.
Vince
