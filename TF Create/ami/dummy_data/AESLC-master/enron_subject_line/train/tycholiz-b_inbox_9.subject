Scott Yule advised that ANG system contracted for roughly 290 M2/day of new delivery capacity (210 to PGT & 80 to Southern Crossing).
The Alberta system will expand by 222 M2/day plus an additional 37 M2/day for LRS 2 service.
No capacity was relinquished.
All of this is timed to come on line with the 2002 PGT expansion.
Can you tell from the queue that I forwarded to you -  What is the split between Shippers going to PGT versus Southern Crossing?
Thanks,
