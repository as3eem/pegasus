Jeff, Now that the dust has started to settled (only slightly), I just want to write this note to wish you well.
There are times when looking out for #1 is of paramount importance.
While we are not in touch with one another to any great extent, I do empathize with you on the strains that you must have encountered over the last few years!
Actually, I probably have no conception of the strain and pressure!
Nonetheless, I hope we can remain in touch.
To the extent that can help in any way (and I don't mean to be presumptuous), I would be delighted to do so.
Best regards,

@subject
Wishing You Well!
