Dear Colleague:      I would like to call your attention to three fine Penn students on the job market this year, Sean Campbell, Clara Vega, and Canlin Li.
Their interests and skills span time series econometrics, financial economics and macroeconomics.
I have attached my letters of recommendation, which provide much more detail.
I hope that you will seriously consider interviewing them if their skill match your needs; please simply contact them directly if you want to do so and/or if you would like more materials from them (their contact information follows at the end of this email).
In addition, please don't hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance in any way.
Finally, I hope that you will excuse the intrusion caused by this communication, but email is the least intrusive and most efficient way that I know to get the message out.
With best
