On August 28, 2001, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) filed revisions to its Market Administration and Control Area Services Tariff in order to establish the criteria by which it will evaluate the need to reestablish Regulation penalties and to define factor Kpi, a factor used in the calculation of availability payments made to Suppliers of Regulation service.
The filing is being made to comply with a Commission order.
NYISO has requested an effective date of July 25, 2001 for the tariff provisions.
(Notice issued Sept. 7; interventions/protests due Sept. 18, 2001.)
If you would like a copy of the filing or any further information, please let me know.
