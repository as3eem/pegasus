Gerald:      Attached is a revised draft of the letter which the Police Jury requested prior to the sale.
I took out the reference to "presence of" referring to hazardous waste.
Please transmute the letter to LRCI stationery and have a corporated rep sign, and return to me for delivery to the Police Jury.
