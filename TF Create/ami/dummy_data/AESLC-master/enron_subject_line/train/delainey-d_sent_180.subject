Barry, I have not spoken to Whitt yet - working on this week.
I would suggest that you will need to get a few bright managers/associates to  manage the mid-market and a couple of more experienced originators (internal  or external?)
to complement.
I would start thinking about how to get that  done.
I would call Oxley for help if needed.
Regards
