I will be out of the office (vacation) until the 27th and didn't  want to lose the entire week.
Mark  ps - I lost all of my voice mails the other day and I think there was one  from you regarding a possible conflict - my understanding is that we're just  assigning a bunch of transactions over from one party to another and in that  case I tend to think there's no problem.
