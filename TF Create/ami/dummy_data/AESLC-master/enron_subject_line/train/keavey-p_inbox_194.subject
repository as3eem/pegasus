Please respond to feedbackDear Peter, At Travelocity, we love to travel.
We enjoy seeing new sights,  meeting new people, and trying new restaurants.
There's just one  thing we don't like about traveling: the cost (we're guessing you  know what we're talking about!).
But we've come up with something  that can help.
The Travelocity Preferred Traveler Program offers a unique package of  discounts, upgrades, and special perks to help make your travel,  shopping, and dining experiences less expensive--and more enjoyable.
