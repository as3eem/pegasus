Susan:   (1) We need to have the following agreement with Goldman  re-executed.
I have the prior agreement in my office (if you want it).
Please let me see the cover letter you submit to Lisa.
Please add this to  the equity list.
(2)  I will give you Direct Trading for execution.
It should also be added  to the equity list.
(3)  I think we need to add a reference to the First Boston Enron Corp.  account to the equity list.
