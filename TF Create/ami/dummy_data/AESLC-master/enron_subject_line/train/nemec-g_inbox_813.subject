Gerald,  This is a follow-up to my earlier e-mail about the discovery request from John Haswell, 352-376-5226.
Perhaps you have already spoken to him.
I'm traveling today and tomorrow.
On vacation next week.
I am in the office Friday and reachable much of the week (when not on an airplane).
Call when you can.
Bill
