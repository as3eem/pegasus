There's something about cycling that brings out the best.....and here's a couple of great examples of the very best.....Ansel Michaels and his valiant, successful attempt to do the distance, and Charles Delacey's desire to help make that journey less painful for Ansel.
I hope you find it in your hearts to salute the efforts of each of them by offering your support.
Charles is a member of Team Enron and was the first rider in to LaGrange this year, arriving 11:15 am.
