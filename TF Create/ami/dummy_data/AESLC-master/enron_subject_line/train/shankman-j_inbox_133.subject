To correct the list I gave you as to ELFI: Jeff, you are the President and COO; Mike, you are the Chairman & CEO.
Jeff, by the way, Enron Intelligence Exchange (a Cayman entity) was formed in 2000 by the LNG group to be a company to participate in the internet trading of LNG.
Obviously, no activites to date.
I still need to find out the purpose of Enron Administrative Services Corp.
I will let you know tomorrow.
