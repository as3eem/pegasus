=09I apologize for this e-mail being so late.
I know that probably someone=  has already sent in an email with this comment, especially during the time=  =09you requested the employees let you know how we could all pull together=  to improve the outlook that the outside world has on Enron.
I had a =09ge= ntleman on our floor a few weeks back, that told me he had worked for Enron=  a while back, he said the most damaging thing that hurts Enron in =09the p= ublic eye, is the fact that a person can seldom talk to the same person in = a department more than a few times before their contact in that =09departme= nt moves to another department or leaves.
He said it gives the public a fee= ling of insecurity in trusting a company where the employees =09move around=  so much.
I hope this doesn't upset you, I just thought I would let you kno= w what one gentlemen told me regarding the company.
I =09absolutely love th= e foundation that you have built Enron on, and I only hope that more compan= y's follow suit.
Have a wonderful day.=20 =09
