Ben,  This email has the prices in Exhibit N of the current draft agreement.
Are  these the correct numbers?
Kathy and I discussed your comments, and she is making changes to the  contract consistent with those comments.
She is not available this  afternoon, but is free tomorrow am to discuss the contract.
Please let me  know if tomorrow am works for you.
Kay
