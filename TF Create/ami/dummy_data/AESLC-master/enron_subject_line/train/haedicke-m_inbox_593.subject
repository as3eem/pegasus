Mark,  re.
the above, we are working on a significant number of divestments (very important transactions for cashflow reasons totalling potentially over 500MM US) in Europe that are likely triggers; I urgently need to address this with you guys - Michael Brown wants me to sort out a waiver letter / procedure before the weekend.
Can't get a hold of Lance.
Could you or Lance give me a shout this morning.
Thanks, Marcus
