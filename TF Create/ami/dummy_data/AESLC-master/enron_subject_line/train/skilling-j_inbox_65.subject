Mr. Skilling,  Rev.
Lawson would like to thank you for extending to him the invitation to participate in the 2001 Big Cats Gala on June 14, 2001 at the Bronx Zoo in New York.
Unfortunately, he will not be able to attend the event, and the Wheeler Avenue budget for this year is not such that we can comfortably make a contribution.
He would like to convey to Mr. Lay, however, that he rejoices with this esteemed honor and will continue to keep his friend in his prayers.
Thank you,
