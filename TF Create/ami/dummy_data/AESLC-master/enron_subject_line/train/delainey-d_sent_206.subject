Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.
This has been  sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed  some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter  or so.
Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the  deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to  closure.
Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some  value for Enron to take this deal including:  a) $200 M in TCV for 2000;  b) $3 to $5 M in value;  c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the  large industrial customers;  and d) provides an "in" to the GE family of companies which could result in  significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.
Regards
