Sara: Here are drafts of the Certificates and Sight Drafts for Niagara Mohawk, El Paso electric, LG&E Energy Marketing and Energy Production Corp. (just in case it wasn't renewed).
I have put together files for each of these that include copies of the LC, the underlying trading docs and any correspondence that has been sent.
Except for Niagara Mohawk which requires copies of the invoices and that the certificate be on "letterhead" there don't appear to be any other special requirements.
Leslie Reeves will be faxing the invoices to us.
I will be in tomorrow until around 11.
Thanks for your help on this.
All of these docs are in a file called Enron Restructuring.
