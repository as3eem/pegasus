Dear Vince,  It is my pleasure to invite you to speak again at "EPRM 2001 Europe", Energy & Power Risk Management magazine's fourth annual European energy risk management congress which will be taking place in Amsterdam on 6 & 7 September 2001.
As you know, last year's congress attracted over 200 attendees and provided the ideal opportunity for leading institutions to discuss the key issues and latest developments in pricing, trading and risk management strategies for power and gas.
Please find attached a draft copy of the conference programme.
I have left the invitation open as I was unsure of your specific topic of interest.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
