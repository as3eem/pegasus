I understand that you will be meeting with Harry Clark on Wednesday, and thought I should share with you my impression of him.
I have had mutual clients with Harry, and although I have a bias against guys in his business, I found him extraordinarily useful.
For one thing, he is intelligent; for another, perhaps as a consequence of the first, he doesn't over promise; for still another, I have never seen him give a client bad advice.
He is certainly worth a serious hearing.
Let me repeat here what I have said in a note sent to your home: if there is anything I can reasonably do to be useful let me know.
See you in San Antonio.
