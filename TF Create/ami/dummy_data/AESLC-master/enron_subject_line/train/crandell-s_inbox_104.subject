Last night our main 'Server' failed, and we have been working since to restore service.
It looks like we lost NO data   For the time, you cannot get to your H:, P:, W:, R: (Local Drives)   I have no ETA.
You will have trouble starting some programs.
Terminal Server is UNAFFECTED:   Houston Based Data is UNAFFECTED:   I will follow up with more news / details later   Victor and Paul are available to help get you with anything we can.
Thank you for your patience
