Hey there!
Saw your brother again last night.
Where were you?
I think I have given up on Taco Milagro.
Very nasty crowd that hangs out there now.
I say that every week..but it's just so close to my place that it makes it easy to hang out there and then not have far to drive home!
Anyway, sometimes your brother acknowledges me and sometimes he doesn't.
Maybe he didn't see me.
What are you up to this weekend?
