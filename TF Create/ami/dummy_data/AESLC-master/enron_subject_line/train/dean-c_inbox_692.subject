I will be out of the office on vacation Oct. 1st (Monday) through the 8th (Monday) and will return back in the office on Tuesday the 9th.
For any assistance during my absence please see Anna.
She will be able to help you with expense reports, business travel,  conference room booking and any other needs you may have while I am away.
For assistance with cell phones please see Kathy Sheppard.
If an issue can wait until I get back then please come see me on the 9th and  I will be happy to help.
