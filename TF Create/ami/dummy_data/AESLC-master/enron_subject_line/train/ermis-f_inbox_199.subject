High Inventory:  Customer supply is required to be within the tolerance band percentage of daily usage to avoid OFO noncompliance charges.
Supply lower than usage is not subject to OFO  noncompliance charge.
Charges for Noncompliance:  -   Noncore customers with AMR and PG&E's Electric Generation charges are based on actual     daily metered usage.
-   Noncore customers without AMR charges are based on ADQ     or actual daily metered usage, whichever results in a lesser charge.
-  Core Procurement Group charges are based on the latest core load forecast.
Please call the CGT Helpline 1-800-343-4743 if you have any questions.
