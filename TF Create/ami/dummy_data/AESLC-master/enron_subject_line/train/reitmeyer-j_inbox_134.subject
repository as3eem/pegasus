Who says the power of prayer doesn't work?
I am happy to report that my dad's hip doesn't seem to be broken after all.
The x-rays, and CAT scan show no signs of a fracture, even though all symptoms indicated such a break.
His pain is gone and this morning he was able to "stand up" in the hospital room.
Later today they are going to do an MRI and a Bone Scan on him to see what might have caused the pain and lack of movement in his leg.
Please continue to keep Gordon Martin in your prayers, and, Praise God that his hip is not broken!
