Hello, Jeff,  I just wanted to let you know that I'll be at a mandatory Values meeting (you remember those, right?)
from 2:00 to 4:00 pm.
EST and will be back in the office by 5:00 p.m.  Hope this doesn't mean we miss one another.
If there's a problem, please e-mail or call me with a number you can be reached at today/tonight and I'm happy to contact you at a time of your convenience.
Warm Regards,
