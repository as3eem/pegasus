Hi Everyone,   I have accepted a position with Duke Energy and will be starting there effective Monday, January 21st, but before I go I wanted to let you all know how much it has meant to me to be able to work with such outstanding people as yourselves over the years.
I will miss you all and I sincerely hope our paths continue to cross in the future, both professionally and personally.
I wish you all the best...
