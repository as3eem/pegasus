We have a spreadsheet showing old 2002 plan that everyone agreed to a few months ago before all the fun started.
We have EA, EGM, EIM, EEL, EBS, EES, ENW, Corp., CommodityLogic, and Other broken out by EnronOnline, Operations, IT development and IT infrastructure which is further broken down by expense and capital and totals (we separated out depreciation as well so we could see what was cash and non-cash).
We are currently trying to put together the adjusted or new 2002 Plan along side the above numbers based on the estimates from the last week or so and will try to be done late tonight.
Thanks.
