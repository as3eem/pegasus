Enron Corporation, The Princeton Review, and the Association of Rice Alumni would like to invite you to:  THE 2001 HALLOWEEN MONSTER BASH  Houston's definitive, all-out Halloween party:  	Friday, October 26 	8:00 pm 	Garden in the Heights  We are proud to announce the return of the Halloween Monster Bash on Friday, October 26 at Garden in the Heights.
You may remember this party from 1998; it was a smash success then and will be at least as much fun this year.
We've got an awesome DJ, and tickets include light food and all the drinks you can handle.
Door prizes including gift certificates from Houston's finest restaurants will be awarded for best costumes.
The tickets are essentially at a break-even price, but if there is any money left over, it will go to Rice's scholarship/fellowship fund, so Rice can continue to attract even smarter, harder-working students than they've already got.
