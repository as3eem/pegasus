Your packages for the Enron Center Garage are ready for pick-up at EB305, please make sure that you bring your current parking card with you at the time of pick-up, we will exchange your access card for a transponder.
( We will fax a memo to the Garage, so that you will be able to get out of the garage at the end of the day).
Thank you,
