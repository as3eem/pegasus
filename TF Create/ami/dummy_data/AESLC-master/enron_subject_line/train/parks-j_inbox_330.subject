Hi Joe, I received Mike Richards' comments.
Other than word changes which he and I had discussed there are three changes that I need to discuss with you: (1) an agreement between the parties to work in good faith to resolve the pre-bankruptcy storage fees and file for bankruptcy approval within 30 days (don't worry about the bankruptcy angle, just the business side); (2) instead of "as is" language, no warranty as to fitness for intended use, ordinary use or a particular purpose; and (3) potential offset with other post-petition costs.
Give me a call-5-3910.
