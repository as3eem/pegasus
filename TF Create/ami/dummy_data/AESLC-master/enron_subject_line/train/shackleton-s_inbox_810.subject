We received the cash PSCC promised to pay.
As best we can determine they are paid in full and their financial positions are now expired.
Susan: Please note both "paid in full" and "expired" on the Demand Letter Log.
Maria: Please reclassify this CP as "expired" on our list.
When you rerun the Apr02-forward MTM this CP should show $0.
If not, let's investigate.
Thanks all.
