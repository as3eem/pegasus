As promised, although a little later than expected, a draft agenda is  attached at the end of my memo to Mike.
The memo will walk you through the  agenda.
Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.
Again,  I an sorry that you will not be able to join us, but I am pleased that so  many others from the London office will be in attendance.
