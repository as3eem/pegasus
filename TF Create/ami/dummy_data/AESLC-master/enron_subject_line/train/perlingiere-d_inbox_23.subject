All,  We are currently working on the data model for the Trading Agreements System and have a question pertaining to internal/external counterparties.
Are all agreements between an internal company(counterparty) and an external company(counterparty)?
I spoke with Meredith Stewart (the data architect for this project) and she found an agreement between 2 internal counterparties, e.g.
Enron Louisiana and ECT.
Please let me know ASAP.
Thanks,
