Here's the latest I've heard from EES regarding ways in which we've managed  to thoroughly confuse them.
I'm researching most of these questions, but as  with last month, there are a few Real Time deals they don't see in the  spreadsheet you guys send to them.
Would you mind checking this out when you  have a minute (or despite the fact that you don't)?
If you revise anything,  just let me know or e-mail it directly to Mark Confer and Brooklyn Couch.
Thanks,
