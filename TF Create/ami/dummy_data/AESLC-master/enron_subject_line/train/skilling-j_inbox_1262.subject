In the wake of Tuesday's tragic events, from which we are all still reeling, we are temporarily suspending our Eyeforenergy subscriber services.
We would like to take this opportunity to convey our deepest condolences to all of our friends in the energy community who have lost friends, colleagues or loved ones as a result of this terrible disaster, and our thoughts are with you.
The Eyeforenergy team.
