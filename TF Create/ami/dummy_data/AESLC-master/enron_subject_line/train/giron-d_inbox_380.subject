Hello, I am sending you this note to let you know that my email address has changed.
I have been having trouble receiving emails from different individuals and have been unable to correct it, so I created a new address.
If you could please now address all emails to me at  dab312@hotmail.com  I would greatly appreciate it.
Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.
Drew Beckman
