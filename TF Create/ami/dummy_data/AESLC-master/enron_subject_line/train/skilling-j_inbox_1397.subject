Dear Mr. Skilling: Just a quick little note.
I would very much like to talk to you when you get a chance.
My guess is that you will probably be taking some time off for awhile.
When you do have some time, please give me a call.
I specialize in the finance(VC and Investment Banks) arena and would love to present someone of your caliber to them.
That is of course, if you are interested in possibly going into that arena.
Sincerely

@subject
