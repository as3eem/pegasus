Michelle  In order to make this interconnect bi-directional the following work need to be performed:  ( capacity 35- 60 mmcf/d at 800-850 # pressure)  1):  Blowdown gas in 5.335 miles of 12" ( gas-loss) at 1000# pressure  2):	Remove a flapper in the check-valve or turn around the existing check-valve   The  cost for this is approximately $8,000 to $10,000.
Still waiting for Earl Chanley from Roswell to send me some facility information regarding the Pecos interconnect.
