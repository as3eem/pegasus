Dear Schwab Client:  As of Thursday September 13, 2001, SchwabFunds(R) Money Funds will be open for Shareholder transactions and will continue to be open for business each day that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the "Fed") is open.
This change to the Schwab Money Funds' business days is designed to provide shareholders the ability to access their cash investment while the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") remains closed.
Typically, the Schwab Money Funds are open for business only on days that both the Fed and the NYSE are open.
