Vince,    I would like to offer you to be the chairman for  the morning stream session "On-Line  Trading & Risk  Management" (8th November,  11.45-13.15), to introduce the speakers (Spyros Maragos, Per Hjorth and Les Clewlow)  and lead the discussion.
Would you be interested in doing  that?
Kind Regards,
