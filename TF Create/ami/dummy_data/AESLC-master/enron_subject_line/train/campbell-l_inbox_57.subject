Attached is the final agenda and list of attendees for the September 20-21st EDI Conference which is being held by the NY PSC in Albany.
I have noted that many of the Marketers currently active in KeySpan's territory are not listed as attendees for this conference.
It is still not to late to register to attend.
Once again I must stress the importance of all of our Marketers being prepared for the transition to EDI.
Once the final transition has been made, Marketers who are not EDI compliant will not be able to do business in our territories.
If you wish to attend, please contact either John D'Aloia, PSC Staff or myself.
Thank you.
