Joe: If we need to develop a form of confirm for this, are you the person that I  should work with or would someone else handle this?
Rod, Since we are doing a separate GTC for this product, we will not be able to  "net" on any payment date what we owe the counterparty under this product  against what the counterparty may owe us under other derivative products.
Are you okay with this?
Alos, we have been assuming that there are no other  counterparty credit issues with this product since other than the upfront  premium, payments will be made from us to them.
Are we safe in assuming this?
Carol
