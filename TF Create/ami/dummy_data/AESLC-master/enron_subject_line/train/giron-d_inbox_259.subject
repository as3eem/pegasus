Attached are two letters to Hutchison and Gramm dealing with  RR retirement bill   All you have to do is print them out, sign them and  put a stamp and address on an envelope and then mail them.
Please do  this...we are down to the wire on this bill.
Remember  that it in no  way means any money out of your pocket...just would allow railroaders to retire  at age 60 rather than 62 and make more money available to widowers/widows.
Darnell   p.s.
last time I will ask you for help on this.
