Alan and Wayne: We received a letter from AEP Energy Services Inc. terminating all coal transactions with ENA as of 12/1.
The letter states that they shall begin liquidating the contracts on 12/3.
We have been instructed by Sally Beck's group to identify any terminated transactions that should be taken out of the book.
Should these and if so, which transactions are these?
