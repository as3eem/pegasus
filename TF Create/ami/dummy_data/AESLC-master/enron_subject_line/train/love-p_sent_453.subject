Dawn, thanks for putting this information in the paper.
Hopefully a student from  Haleyville that goes to Auburn in the future can apply for the scholarship.
A scholarship in memory of Dr. W.H.
Burgess has been set up at the school of  Veterinary Medicine at Auburn University.
The scholarship has been ear  marked for students that are in need of financial assistance and have an  interest in the area of large animal practice, an area in which Dr. Burgess  dedicated much of his professional life in Haleyville, Alabama where he  practiced for 35 years.
If you would like to make contributions to the scholarship in his name, you  can do so as follows: Auburn University Foundation c/o Sam Hendrix 317 South College Street Auburn University, AL 36849
