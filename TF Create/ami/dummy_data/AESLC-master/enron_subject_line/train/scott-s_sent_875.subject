As you will note from the email address, my last name is Scott.
If that is  not enough information to derive my number I will have to question the level  of intelligence I had previously afforded you.
However, as I hate having my  illusions shattered, I'll save myself from possible disappointment and just  give you the number...ext.
31455.
