Hi Tracy, earlier this week you mentioned you might email out earnings targets this week.
I have not yet received them from you.
I will be on vacation all next week, so if the targets are set or you have any information to forward us, please copy Dee and he will reply to you or route the information as needed.
Have a nice weekend, jb
