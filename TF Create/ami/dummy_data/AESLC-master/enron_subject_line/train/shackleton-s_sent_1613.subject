Tanya:  I just spoke with Chris about this ARCO transaction which might trade  TODAY.
We are "cleaning up" some of the language as it was based on the  prior ARCO deal (when we were ECT).
Please note that Enron Corp. previously  provided a guaranty.
I am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the  transaction specifically and I'll try to track down.
Will ENA provide a  parent guaranty for the new transaction?
Please let me know.
Thanks.
Sara
