Group,  I was informed this afternoon, around 1530 PDT, by Mike at the ISO, that Harbor's wavier rights were taken away due to higher than normal loads expected for tomorrow, Tuesday 10/2.
So, we need to put in supplemental energy bids in for both Harbor units, HARBGN_7_UNITS (80mw) and HARBGN_7_PL2X3 (17.9mw).
Please submit bids as soon as possible, at least by HE20 Monday, 10/1, going through HE24 on Tuesday, 10/2, for both units, at the real-time price cap, of $91.
If the ISO hits the bid, go ahead and accept the bid, and then call the control room to tell them to ramp up.
Thanks a bunch,
