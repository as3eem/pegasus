I am inviting some Enron folks over for drinks and a light supper buffet this Sunday around 3:00 pm, finishing up in time for a good night's sleep.
I hope you can attend, but don't feel obligated.
Kids/spouses/significant others are invited.
Don't worry about bringing anything.
Let me know if you plan on coming by responding to this e-mail.
