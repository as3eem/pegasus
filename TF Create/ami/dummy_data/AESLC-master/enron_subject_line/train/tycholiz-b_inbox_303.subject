Hi Barry,  I have sent to you in the mail an article regarding the situation with your stock account at TD.
Our best advice is to probably close out the account per TD and do online trading, if that suits you, or move the funds to the US.
Re the cottage in Riding Mountain - go ahead.
Two things:  it isn't useable in the winter, so it's not available for your use and the second thing is that you are going to be purchasing it AFTER you've become a non-resident.
Amex Card - probably isn't a huge issue to use the Canadian one, but it is a tie.
Please call with any further enquiries or for clarification.
Best regards,
