Chris: Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward  contracts" in the Bankruptcy Code in order to improve our position with  respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?
I am not sure  what chnages we would want, but was wondering if there was any opportunity to  suggest a change.
Let me know what you think.
Thanks.
