Hello Barry,  My name is Todd Neugebauer and I am a manager in EBS Wholesale Origination in Europe.
I came over here as an associate in February and was promoted in June.
I am looking to move back into one of our more core areas and Ted Bland recommended I speak to you, or someone in your group.
If you have a need, I am going to be in Houston late next week and would be able to meet then to discuss any opportunities.
Regards,
