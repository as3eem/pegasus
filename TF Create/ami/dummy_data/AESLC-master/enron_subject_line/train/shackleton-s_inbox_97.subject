Sara:  Please confirm that Sheila Glover and Gary Hickerson are authorized to sign the wire transfers requests we are receiving on the ECI, ECTI and ECTEF accounts.
I have just left you a voicemail with the same request.
It is fairly urgent as we are trying to get the wires out today.
Thanks and regards.
