Pat Hallisey ws kind enough to pass on this information.
Just a note that our good friend Cathy Pauls (acacia north) passed away yesterday morning.
Visitation is at 10-11 Sat.
morning with a mass at St. Mary's catholic church at 11:00am.
This is all the info I have but Cathy was loved by all that new her.
She will be sadly missed.
Pat  Our thought and prayers are with the family.
