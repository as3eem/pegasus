HAPPY Friday (Go Devils)..........  No Interruptible storage on our system for the weekend.
The rising temperatures are eating into our excess injectibility.
Interruptible transportation is available.
I realize that the spread between Niagara and Leidy is tight in June but July basis has been attractive.
I am able to set up contracts for next month now.
Have a great weekend.
