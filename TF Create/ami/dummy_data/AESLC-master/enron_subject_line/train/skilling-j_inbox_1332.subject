<<MF September 4th 2001.pdf>>  			Good Tuesday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!
Last week, the markets got so oversold, that the ARMS Index (a technical market measure that, broadly speaking, indicates how oversold the market is), closed above 2.00 on two consecutive days for the first time since Oct. 16 and 19, 1987!!
It is, apparently, one of the rarest occurrences in the world of technical analysis.
As we said, it has been 14 years since the the markets generated such a reading.
The NYSE is currently rallying however, tech is still struggling.
Lets hope today's strength translates broadly across all sectors.
The 30 -year bond yield is 5.49%.
