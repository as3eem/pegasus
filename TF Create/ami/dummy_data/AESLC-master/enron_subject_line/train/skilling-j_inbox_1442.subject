Jeff,   Enron just lost one of the best  thinkers, innovators, doers, and people I've ever worked with.
It is a great  loss for a company you've worked so hard to build up and I'm not sure they can  recover or prosper.
I've still got a note to call  you and see if we can get together for dinner when I'm in Houston.
I want to see  this house you've built and catch up.
Let me know the best way to reach you  now.
Regards,
