Over the past few weeks, we have received numerous requests for information about changes to Enron's business policies and procedures since filing for bankruptcy, so we developed REORIENTATION.
It's a short session designed for employees to outline current benefits and services, and to provide a better understanding of the bankruptcy process.
Agenda items include: - An update on the Credit Union - A Legal Overview, including some things you should know about bankruptcy - Status of the Enron Building, including space management, churns and building services - A review of Employee Benefits - A presentation from the Resolution Center - An update on existing Employee Services - An overview Employee Self Service, including how to access or change your own employee information  Each session will be held in EB5C2 and is limited to 50 participants, so you must RSVP if you would like to attend.
Simply select a button above to indicate the date and time you would like to attend.
You will then be sent a confirmation email.
If you have a question about this program or a suggestion for a future program, please contact Alicia Jenkins at 5-4651.
