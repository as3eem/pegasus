Hi there,  I think a good next step while the counterparties are reviewing the docs is  the creation of a closing checklist, since we have a good starting point with  the Intergen closing list.
We can get organized on putting together a  package of the next traunche of docs, such as the parent guaranty, escrow  agreement, etc.
Thanks,
