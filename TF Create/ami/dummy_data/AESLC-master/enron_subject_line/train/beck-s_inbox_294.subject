Due to the announcement Friday of the new organization of the trading groups to EWS, and the decision to include the risk control groups as part of Enron NetWorks, please hold off on making any of the below noted moves until we have resorted everything out.
We will endeavor to have this clarified by mid-week to enable us to make everything effective as of April 30.
Thanks
