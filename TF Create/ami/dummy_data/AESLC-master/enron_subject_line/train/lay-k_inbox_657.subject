Ken,  I am not a smart man.
However I saw enron stock reached $26, I worry one thing.
Under current situation it is difficult to make more money.
How could we boost stock price?
Enron hired enough people already.
It is the time to cut cost, freeze hiring new people now.
Freezing hire is much more better than lay off in a near future.
Thanks.
