Vince, I enjoyed your presentation at the SIAM workshop last Friday.
I have a much greater appreciation for the difficult problems you all solve.
If at all possible, I would like to get a copy of your talk and any references to review papers in the general area of market modeling and potentially control.
Have a great weekend.
Best Regards,
