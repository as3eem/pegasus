Here is my attempt at modifying the letter to conform to our discussions this afternoon.
The redline markings indicate changes to a clean version of the draft sent yesterday.
This draft incorporates a slightly modified version of the confidentiality statement you provided earlier today (changed Parties' to Party, etc.).
Please acknowledge receipt.
