market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Market Participants:  The NYISO Back-Up Dispatch System is scheduled to be tested on Tuesday, October 2, 2001.
The test will begin at about 10:30 a.m. and last for approximately one hour.
Security Constrained Dispatch (SCD) will be stopped, but the mainframe computer will continue to operate, allowing the NYISO to monitor security.
If a situation occurs, the Shift Supervisor will be able to re-start SCD and take appropriate action.
The Market Information System (MIS) and Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) will remain available during the test.
If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.
