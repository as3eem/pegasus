Bill,  I need to have FT-DENVER set up in TDS.
The trader is Jay Reitmeyer.
There  are two Tagg books that need to be mapped to this:  FT-DENVER and  INTRA-DENVER.
The following people in Risk need access to the book:  Darron  Giron, Chris Walker, Pat Ryder, Jason Wolfe, Carole Frank, Anne Bike, and  Jennifer Bagwell.
I also want it to roll up into ALL-WEST.
Call me if you  have any questions.
Thanks for your help.
