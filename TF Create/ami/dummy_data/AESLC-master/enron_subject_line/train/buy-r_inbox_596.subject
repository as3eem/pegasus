Rick, Attached is the significantly scaled down version of the RAC presentation we anticipate using for the taped Bloomberg mid-year credit review.
Please let me know if you have any comments or other changes once you have had a chance to review.
As we discussed earlier, we do not yet know when the taping will be.
If it is after August 15th, we will plan on working with Bill Bradford and Dave Gorte on this.
Thanks.
Shirley
