As we discussed today, east curve files have been set up.
There is 1 file for physical curves and 2 files containing basis, index, and Y curves.
I have saved them out to O:\_Dropbox\Scott P\.
Please take a look at these and have who ever is going to set each of them establish any needed links.
They can save them out to the same directory.
Risk needs this done by Wednesday afternoon.
Thanks.
