Dear Rosalee,  Please forward to Ken.
thanks.
I am attaching my cv for you to have handy.
If you are restructuring Enron in the US and overseas let me know if I can give you a hand on the international side.
Fyi, I am currently working as a consultant for the Bunge Corp and Bunge International, an agribusiness company that went public this year in the US.
( stock symbol is BG.)
Regards and have a great holiday season.
