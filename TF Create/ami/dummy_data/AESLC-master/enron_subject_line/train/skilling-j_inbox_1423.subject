Hello, Jeff,  I know you must be quite busy with calls for interviews following your recent announcement that you were leaving Enron.
However, I'm hoping if you have a moment today, you could provide 2 or 3 quotes about your decision and where you're heading next for McKinsey & Company's internal news Web site, NewsNetwork, which has loyal readership across our Firm.
Our upcoming deadline is tomorrow afternoon in time for our Monday, August 20 edition.
Given that we covered you once before on NN (see article below) we believe this article would make for an important and worthy follow up.
I will take the liberty of calling you today to ensure you received this message.
Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.
Warm Regards,
