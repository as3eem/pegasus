Lisa/Rose,  Attached is the most recent draft of the facility agreement for the  LM6000's.
This version was prepared for the Austin project and therefore  lacks any DevCo specific references or requirements.
Your input as to any  lender requirements, as well as the rights and responsibilities of the agent,  would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
