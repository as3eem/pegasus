Jim, my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on  whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale  businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken.
I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure  until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.
I'm  not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond  what was outlined in the original memo.
However, I am in agreement that this  needs to get resolved ASAP unfortunately Frevert and Skilling and most of the  first world is out this week.
I ask for your patience.
Lets discuss.
Regards
