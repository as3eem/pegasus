Please note the attached letter from Nancy Cianflone.
The intent here is to let you know that KeySpan Energy Delivery has hedged 27% of our flowing winter supply.
This was done in order to mitigate any spikes in this winters market.
You may want to take this into account when pricing your winter contracts.
