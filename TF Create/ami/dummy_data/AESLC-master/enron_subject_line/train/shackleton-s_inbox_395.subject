Sara,  We have a Master Agreement with NAB Limited.
However, we are doing our FX trades with NAB London.
Presumably, this is simply a branch of NAB Limited which is headquartered in Australia.
Is this a mulitbranch agreement?
Does it cover trades with the London branch?
Let me know what you think.
Thanks!
