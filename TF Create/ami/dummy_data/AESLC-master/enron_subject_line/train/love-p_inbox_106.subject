The current schedule is :          Oct : Kam  (I forgot what topic you were going to do)     Nov :  John - a revisit of OA (this time with a working overhead)     Dec :  skip - I suggest we skip Dec since there will be quite a few vacations taken, holidays, etc.
For the other topics, why don't you decide among yourselves, who is going to do what and when.
Please just let me know so that I can be sure we have things scheduled for Jan going forward.
Let me know if you have questions.
Greg
