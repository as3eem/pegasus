Dear Steve:  As per your voicemail message, I have asked the HRGIS team to provide the necessary information so we can send an email message, regarding certification, to those employees at the Vice President level and above, and those employees who have not certified compliance to date.
Please see the draft message prepared for your review and comments:    	"As you know, Enron has adopted certain policies, with the approval of the Enron Board of Directors, all of which are set forth in Enron's Code of Ethics.
In order to ensure our continuing compliance, please carefully read the policies and re-submit your statement of personal agreement by ___________________________(date).
