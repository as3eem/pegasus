Dear Vince,  I have attached the invoice for the workshop that Beth O'Sullivan and I conducted for your group last month as well as a summary of the workshop evaluation.
I am sorry for the delay, but we were waiting to receive more of the workshop evaluations so that we could provide you a more complete assessment of the workshop by the attendees.
As it is, we only collected 11 responses of the 17 attendees.
I will also send you a copy of this invoice in the mail and will be glad to send you the actual evaluation forms completed by the attendees if you would like to have them.
As mentioned in the attached, we enjoyed working with your group and hope that you can see the difference the training made in the presentation ability of the attendees.
