Ken:  When things settle down and you can get away, Polly and I would love to host the Lays out here in the Sonoma Valley.
The guest house is done on our Sonoma farm and we would love to see you.
We realize that Aspen is always there for you, but if you want some sunshine and wine-tasting, please don't hesitate--and calling us at the last minute
