As we discussed, I never received a confirmation of the May, June and July forward gas purchase (1,000 per day at Ventura at $2.895/mmBtu).
This purchase was made through Brian Frihart.
I need to know if Enron plans to stand behind this purchase.
Without confirmation, I will assume that the deal is no longer valid.
