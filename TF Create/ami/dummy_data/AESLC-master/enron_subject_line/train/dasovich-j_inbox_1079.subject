Jeff - per Beth Apollo's message.
The bottom line is what CSC really needs to be able to invoice Calif power customers is the 810 EDI files from all 3 CA utitlities.
They have stopped sending 810s to us and are only providing 867's.
If we can't get the 810s going then the information provided in the attached spreadsheets needs to get to us in order to invoice.
This info could come via spreadsheet, or line item within the 867.
The business impact to Enron is that we have not been able to invoice for these customers since Dec 5 and this is a large revenue amount.
