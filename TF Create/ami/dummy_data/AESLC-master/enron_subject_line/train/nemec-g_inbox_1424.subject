Attached is my draft of the "two-pager" for LLC.
Obviously it is going to be a bit longer than two pages.
Please take a look and provide any comments that you might have.
Also:  1)  Gerald please provide summaries of the debtor contracts as you did for NNG and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo; 2)  Karen - please continue your efforts (in cooperation with Mark) to provide the revenues/expenses both actual and forecasted to be attached to the memo; 3)  Mark - please provide the deal structure diagrams for the deals (obviously you already gave me Gallup - but please forward to me electronically) and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo.
I really would like to have this memo completed by mid-day tomorrow so that I can get it to Patty M as promised.
Thanks in advance for your efforts.
Regards
