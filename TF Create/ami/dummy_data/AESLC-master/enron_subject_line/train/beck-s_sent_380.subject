Just wanted to let you know where we will be over the next week.
I am still  at the office hoping to get away before dinner so that I can head home and  pack.
I will call when we are back in Houston on Sunday, July 16.
Mom and Dad,  hope that you have fun if you are going on your trip!
Love, Sally   Saturday, July 8, 2000
