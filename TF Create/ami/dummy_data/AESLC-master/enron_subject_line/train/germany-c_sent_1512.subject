Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF  +.01.
and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005.
The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.
I just added the purchase deal on  CGAS, it was not in Sitara.
Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover  the ANR variable cost plus $.02.
