Apologies to anyone I did not include on the mail I sent earlier today...  As a recap, we had some issues this weekend with Questar, Overthrust, and one cycle each of Kinder Morgan and Transcolorado.
I reset all failed jobs this afternoon, and Overthrust appears to still be having problems as I write this...cycles 1 and 3 for Overthrust have failed again, due to web site errors.
As stated previously, we should look into attempting to recover missed data for the afforementioned pipes as soon as possible.
Also, a call to Overthrust might be in order, to see if they expect any more down time.
Thanks,
