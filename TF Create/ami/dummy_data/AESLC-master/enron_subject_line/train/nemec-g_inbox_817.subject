I will be bringing you a letter regarding West Florida Electric Cooperative Association, Inc. vs. Gulf Power Company - Territorial Dispute from Gerald Nemec.
Gerald would like to set up a meeting with both of you to discuss this on Wednesday.
Please call me at 3-9282 or e-mail me (Rae Meadows) and let me know when you will be available to meet with Gerald.
Thank you for your assistance.
Rae Meadows, Administrative Assistant to Gerald Nemec
