Dear Greg  We met some time ago for dinner in London together with Bruce Farmer.
Since a lot of things at Enron are fluid at the moment I wanted to contact you to express Glencore's interest to acquire Enron's copper concentrates and metal book if this is an option Enron would consider.
We understand that the staff in London responsible for these areas are working on a MBO and there is thus little interest from their side to be open or co-operative.
This is the reason why I contact you directly and would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
regards
