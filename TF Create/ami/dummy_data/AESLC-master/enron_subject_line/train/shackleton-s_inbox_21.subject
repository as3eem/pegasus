Greg, 	Derek Lynn suggested I get with you to discuss changing the authorized signatories on the Enron Canada Corp primebroker account at Morgan Stanley.
I am not sure who in the Canada office has the authority to determine who should be authorized to trade or transfer funds from this account.
Please give me a call in the morning to discuss.
I can be reached at 713-853-1439.
Thanks,
