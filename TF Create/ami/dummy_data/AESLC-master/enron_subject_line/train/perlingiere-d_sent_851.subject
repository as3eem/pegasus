I am preparing a re-draft of a previous agreement for this Canadian company.
Credit terms default for Duke Guarantor is 25M/ 50M for Enron.
Triggering  event for both parties is 10M w/ 250 multiples.
Do you want to change  these?
It is my understanding we have guaranties in place.
Please advise  asap.
Thanks!
