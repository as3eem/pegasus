Here is the status of form a without intercompanies.
To date, I have only received Pwr (US & CA), US gas, & liquids.
Can the rest of you let me know when I should expect to receive the info (the schedule itself + the reconciliation to the 11/30 DPR)?
I would like to send out all of the schedules by the end of this week.
Will it be possible for you to meet that deadline?
For those of you who provided me with the info in a different format, I need you to fill in the E&Y doc as we need them all standardized to goto the credit committee.
Status of form A     Thanks
