Gerald, this will confirm our telephone conversation earlier this morning in which you advised me that Enron/LRCI would have no objection to my firm representing Reliant in connection with the referenced matter.
I shall look forward to working with you in bringing this matter to a successful conclusion.
Should you have any questions as this matter proceeds, please do not hesitate to contact me.
