Hi, Patrice.
We are in the process of putting a proposal together for a customer.
The months and volumes are outlined in the attached Excel spreadsheet.
It's probably exactly what Enron is not looking to do, but just in case, I thought I would send it to you.
If you are interested in putting together some numbers, please let me know.
Thanks.
