Greg:   Implement Tradeco.
Determine if Dynegy is willing to lend $850 to $900 million against TransWestern Contact Moody's and ask how much equity we need Tap all potential sources of equity: -	Dynegy -	Federal Reserve/Treasury -	Banks (Citi, Chase) -	Industry players (unlikely in time required) If funds are likely, get stay from Moody's until Monday  Tell me what you want me to do and I'll get after it.
