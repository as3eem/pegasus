Mark, FYI - In my estimation this business is no bigger than Mexico or the  Toronto business ie) $25 to $30M in real value with reasonably high risk.
I  see no value in having two different agendas being pushed in S. America.
I  also believe that we could cut overhead and right size the organization and  not loose any capability.
Early estimations are a reduction in budgeted OH  by at least a third to one-half.
Did you or Jeff speak with Jim?
