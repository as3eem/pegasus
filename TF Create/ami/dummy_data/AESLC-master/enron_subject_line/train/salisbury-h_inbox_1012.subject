Hello all,  Amy would like to meet with each of you individually for about 45 minutes to assess your HR needs.
Her schedule is fairly flexible; however, I would like to go ahead and get things set for either later this week, or early next week.
Please let me know what day and time you will be available to meet with Amy.
Thanks!
