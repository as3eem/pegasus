hey sweetness-  i hope this finds you well.
hows tricks?
looks as if you are wrking for a new firm, hows that going?
i was just in p-town last week, but i was only there for 2 days...otherwise i would have rang you up.
so, i am back down at school in claremont for the term, looks to be a busy one--heavy theory courses and i am working as event coordinator for the california european union center.
also heading to DC in november to present my research  at an anthro conference, so that'll eat up a bunch o' time w/prep work and travel.
