Below is the information for opening the utility accounts in your name.
The phone and cable will be disconnected on Nov. 5, and the water, gas and electricity will be disconnected on Nov. 6.
(If you make the calls prior to these dates and give them the Nov. 6th date, then the water, gas and electricity will not actually be turned off in the house.)
