Janet, if you are ok, I'm ok - we usually only sign these type of  non-solicitations, stand-stills or non-competes if we are well down the road  towards having a reasonable probability to completing a transaction with the  counterparty.
Otherwise, it becomes a nightmare to manage all these.
I will  leave it to your discretion.
Regards
