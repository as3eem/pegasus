At this meeting, Dun & Bradstreet representative Karen Marcom will provide an overview of the Dun & Bradstreet marketing data that Enron will have access to through a global purchase agreement.
This data set is a monthly feed of marketing information, financial stress scores, energy demand estimators, family tree linkage and D&B credit scores, which is a subset of the full D&B database.
Karen will answer questions concerning the presentation of the data and how it will be accessed.
The Dun & Bradstreet database will be available to business units sharing in the cost of the database.
