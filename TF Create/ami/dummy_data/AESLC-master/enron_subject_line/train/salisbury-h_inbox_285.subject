To All Derivatives II attendees:  By now, you should have received your pre-course packets containing the two review quizzes for Derivatives II .
(If you have not, please see me immediately.)
To clear up any possible confusion:   The COMPLETED review quizzes need to be brought to the first day of class--so team up with a buddy to answer the questions!
(I believe that that instructors would like to get an idea of how well you understand the concepts from Derivatives I.)
