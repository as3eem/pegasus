Dear Mr Motley:  I'm writing to tell you that our negotiations with the  International Association of Machinists (IAM) District  141M have produced a tentative agreement on a contract,  ensuring no disruption of service to United customers.
This has been a difficult time, and I want to thank you  for your understanding and continued support.
IAM District 141M will forward the details of the  tentative agreement to its membership for a vote within  the next two weeks.
This decision allows us to continue focusing on serving  you, and I hope it renews your confidence in planning  your travel with United.
We look forward to seeing you  on board.
Thank you,
