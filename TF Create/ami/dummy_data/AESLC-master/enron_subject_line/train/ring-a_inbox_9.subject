Hi Andrea,  Sorry it took so long to get this to you.
Things are a little hectic as we pick up other peoples tasks.
I have been doing east desk fundamentals for about 6 months now, so if you have anymore data or analysis questions please ask, and I might be able to help out.
If you need anything more for the presentation such as other pipe flows, pricing data, etc.
just call  Adam  3-5227
