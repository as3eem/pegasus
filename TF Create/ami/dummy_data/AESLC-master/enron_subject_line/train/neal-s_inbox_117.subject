On-line registration will open at the associations web site (www.sbmsa.org) on July 23rd for the 2001 Season.
We are looking for parents to help volunteer for field day, opening day festivities and fund raising.
Help make 2001 the best year yet!
In addition, we are looking for interested parents in the Northern half of the school district to help with a participation drive this sumer and fall.
Please visit the football section of the web site often for  updates and information on the 2001 Football Season.
