Chris, Rob Milnthorp will give you a call to further discuss the  opportunity.
I would suggest that you find a day over the next couple weeks  to meet Rob in Calgary to speak in detail about the role, the market and  expectations.
I appreciate your openess and let me know how I can help.
The Ontario market is one of the best new market opportunities for ENA over  the next year.
