Done without much fanfare, except by Commissoner Wood, who continued his vitriolic attack on DA and took on green choice as "fraudulent."
The language in the order says no more DA contracts can be entered into after today.
The order directs the utilities to police the DASRs to make sure that none are submitted for contracts signed after today.
There is some strange language that talks about a possible future order to address the comments raised by the parties and putting parties "on notice" that, in this future order, they may suspend all direct access contracts signed on or after July 1, 2001.
Our attorneys are reviewing this, but on first blush, our California attorney says the CPUC would have a difficult time implementing a later retroactive suspension of DA.
