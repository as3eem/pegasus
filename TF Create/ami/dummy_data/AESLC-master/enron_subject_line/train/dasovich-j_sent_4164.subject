FYI.
The agenda for the legislative oversight committee's gas hearing  tomorrow includes two Brattle Group consultants, Paul Carpenter and Matt  O'Loughlin.
They will make up the first panel, titled, "California's High  Natural Gas Prices: Market Power and Other Factors."
In California's gas wars, Edison hired these folks--Carpenter in particular--
