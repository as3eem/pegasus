I've been working with Laura Wente to locate these documents for a couple  days, and I think I've found what you need.
If you could call or e-mail with  your fax number, I'll send what I have over to you and expedite the process.
If you'd like to peruse the EIS documents online, go to  www.tis.eh.doe.gov/nepa/ and click the heading DOE NEPA Analyses.
