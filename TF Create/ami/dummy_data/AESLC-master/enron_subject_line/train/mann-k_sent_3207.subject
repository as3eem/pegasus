First order of business.
Again, we can discuss this on Monday.
I think Ben (or one of his minions) called Carolyn and asked her to be on a  telephone call today.
I have reacted with righteous indignation, and Carlos  is going to tell her it is not necessary for her to be on the call.
I really  hadn't intended for Carolyn to work on this transaction.
Talk to you Monday.
