Attached is the revised Torch Energy Exhibit including the column heading changes, the two pooling point changes, and the percentage splits between IFERC and GD.
Note: If both IFERC and GD volumes were zero for a given point, I made the pricing split as 50/50.
Please review and provide any comments as soon as possible.
Thanks,
