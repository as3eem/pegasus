Transwestern is getting ready to begin testing their new contract system.
In preparation for implementation of the new system, we need to make changes to TW's tariff to allow the option of Electronic Contracting the same way we did to FGT's tariff when we implemented their new system.
The new contract system is scheduled to go into production Q1, 2002.
Teb, do we need a meeting, or can you proceed?
Let me know.
