Geoff -   Attached for your approval are four confirmations for the Ring Trades done among Enron, Reliant, and Bank of Montreal:        You will note that an Exhibit A is attached to each confirm - but  can you tell me from whom at both counterparties I can obtain the Exhibit B (transaction b/t Reliant and BOM) in order to attach that as well.
Please review and advise.
Thanks,
