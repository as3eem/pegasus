Tom , I appreciate the e-mail - sorry for the delay in response.
I am on-side with all your points.
On the New Albany retrofit, I want to  ensure that I am not replacing one patent problem with another so a clear  "title" up front on the new equipment will be important.
However, I will be  interested in hearing your solution especially if it can further reduce NOX  and increase our operating hours.
I share your interest in the FT-4 project hopefully we can take that to the  next level.
Please stay in contact.
Regards
