Mr Skilling,  Thank you for inviting me to participate in the last Executive Forum.
It was very informative.
And it helped me  to understand some of the corporate goals and issues more clearly.
As I mentioned in that meeting,  I think the Xcelerator can be a key tool for leveraging our "soft" assets, as well  as helping Enron develop new business models to lead it into the future.
I also think the Xcelerator can play a key role in creating a balance between technology and commercial realities.
