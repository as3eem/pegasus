Les -  I received the following e-mail from Confirms in Houston re: deals for which  they need unit names.
I sorted through the list and changed the purchases to  "no confirm," and these three deals are what's left.
Could you add the names  in the comments section?
568866 - SELL EWEB AT BPA SYSTEM BORDER 568864 - SELL EWEB AT EWEB SYSTEM BORDER 568860 - SELL LADWP AT MCCULLOUGH  Thanks,
