I have only taken a quick look at the attachment, but thought that I would  forward it to you.
Does it make sense?
$8MM in equipment charges for  us???????
Does that include depreciation (which is not equipment)?
Can you  give me the detail again on everything that falls under the "Consultant"  line?
What is it and which RC's and RC owners have items there.
Thanks.
