The company's determination that leave will be counted as FMLA must be communicated to the employee within two business days of the company receiving sufficient information to determine FMLA coverage.
The employer must commit that to writing by the next payday (or the one after that, if the next payday is less than a week from the date oral notice was given).
This requirement should be communicated to HR/supervisors for compliance purposes.
