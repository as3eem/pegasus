Dear Ken:  I just wanted to let you know that despite all that has happened in the last few days,I am confident that under your leadership we will come back even stronger!
The Enron you have built over the past  years still remains the best place to work today, as it did when I first came on-board as an Associate in the Research Group.
God Bless!
