The hotel we are staying at is the Palm Court Hotel in St Martin-on Orient Beach.
Phone number is 590-87 41 94.
Web site (if you want to check it out tomorrow!)
is palm-court.net...The rooms have refridgerators, and I think breakfast is complimentary.
If you need any other info, let me know..  Stacey/Susie-just tell the cab driver you are going to Orient Beach and once you get there the hotel is on Bikini Beach.
