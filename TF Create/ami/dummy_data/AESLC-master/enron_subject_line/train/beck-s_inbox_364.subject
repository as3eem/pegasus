I had an idea for a project which might eventually do away with the need to have 15 people in a room at 8.30 every day to talk about, amongst other things, data feed timings, content etc.
and I would love your input.
Don't know if you have seen the application they use in the Gas Control Center for monitoring flows etc but it occurred to me that we might like to build something similar that showed all the upstream systems, processes etc, and data feeds to the risk aggregation tools, summary DPR, which would serve as a diagnostic tool for us to assess our risk process every day.
As you know we have been using 3 dimensional real estate to depict market and credit risk like this     and I am experimenting with this concept from a process flow angle, because when looking at this stuff it would be nice to get a feel for the "freshness" of the data and the status of the various tasks in the chain.
Views ?
