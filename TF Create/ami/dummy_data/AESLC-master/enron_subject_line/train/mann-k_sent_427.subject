Hi Nancy,  I am planning to make the changes which arose out of our meeting with VEPCO.
When we met with them, we agreed that we would accept all the changes in this  draft, then blackline against it.
I tried to do this to this document, then  realized that this is a compared document as opposed to a draft marked with  changes.
Can you email me unmarked version which contains all these changes,  and I'll start from there.
I apologize if I already have the clean draft, but I want to be certain that  I am working from the correct version.
Thanks,
