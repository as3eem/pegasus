Ed:  As I mentioned to you, CP want to utilize as much of the Cargill,  Incorporated ISDA as possible.
Cargill, Incorporated was hightly negotiated  and does not provide for affiliate setoff.
DO YOU WANT TO APPROVE THE SAME  LANGUAGE FOR CP?
Please let me know so that we can send the amended master to CP.
Thanks.
