Gerald,  Where are we in the process of gathering e-mails and other discovery that may be responsive to WFLA's request?
Also, can I tell John Haswell that our contract with Gulf does contain a confidentiality clause?
We discussed this but I can't remember if we agreed that I could disclose it.
Bill
