FYI.
Certain aspects of this presentation will relate to PPA's/tolling  agreements/interconnection studies and agreements  relating to Enron  developed generation assets from which we intend to purchase power, etc.
The cost/benefit would probably be marginal for you, but I will be there, and  will get you any interesting handouts.
