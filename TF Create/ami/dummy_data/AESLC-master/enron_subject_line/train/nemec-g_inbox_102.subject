Dear Gerald:  I've received a notice re LRCI, Inc. - Crawfish plant.
We're delinquent on our "Form R6" and a penalty has been levied ($250.00).
I think this is the sort of regulatory matter that used to be handled by Juanita Marchant, who has moved to AEP.
Do you know who is in charge of handling these kinds of filings?
Thanks,
