Pat,  I have reviewed this agreement and provided my comments under a separate  email.
I would appreciate your review of Section 4.14 in particular, given  your familiarity with the compensation plans and benefit plans.
In terms of  timing, your comments probably can go into the next draft, but if you have a  chance to look at 4.14 today, it would be great!
Thanks a lot!
