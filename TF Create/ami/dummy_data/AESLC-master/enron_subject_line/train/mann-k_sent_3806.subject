Hi Kent,  These are some requested changes to the Salmon a/k/a Delta break out  agreement.
I'm not comfortable that Lee has reviewed these, as the comments  were previously forwarded in another email.
In any event, we are looking for  GE's blessings on this addition.
It seems to me that we are approaching time to gather GE's signatures on the  various docs.
I will forward separately the email I received from our  outside counsel with the final forms of everything but the break out  contract, the assignment and assumption agreement and the GE parent guaranty.
Thanks for your assistance.
