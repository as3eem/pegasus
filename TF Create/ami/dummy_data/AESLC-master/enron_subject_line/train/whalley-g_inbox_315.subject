Greg,  ACTION - PLEASE CALL TODD REID AT DUKE  BACKGROUND: Below is the situation with Duke and subs: 						Exposure	Line		Cash		L/C	 Duke Energy Marketing LP / ECC		($43mm)	$10mm		$52.35mm	$20.5mm Duke Energy Trading & Marketing / ENA		($56mm)	$5mm		$61mm Duke Energy Trading & Marketing / EPMI		($260mm)	$20mm		$171mm	$100mm  The expiration of the letters of credit are 11/30/01.
Duke believes that since these L/C's have less than 20 days to expiry their value should be zero and are asking for additional cash collateral.
Our view of the contract is that these L/C's are good collateral until expiry and should be counted in our outgoing collateral.
The roll of the letter of credit has been delayed as Haedicke/Mintz get comfortable with the reps under the L/C facility.
Duke credit guys are saying that Todd Reid has not received a return call from you and this holding up a resolution.
Bill and Louise
