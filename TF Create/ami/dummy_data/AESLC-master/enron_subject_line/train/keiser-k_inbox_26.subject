Kam,  I need your help on something.
I am trying to compile a listing of all reports that were being run by the Risk leads and Specialist on a daily basis for the estate.
If you could please give me a general idea of the daily reports that you know of, I would greatly appreciate it.
I am doing this to ensure that we don't skip  or miss anything that was being done on a day to day basis for the estate.
I will take what info you give me and forward it on to Greg Couch so that he will be aware of all reports that needs to be ran daily.
Thanks
