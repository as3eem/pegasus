Mr. Griffith, Hello my name is Garth Camp and I am a close friend of Jeb Ligums.
I wanted to first thank you for the contact at Carr Futures, Mr. Heffner, I really appreciate it.
At this point have have emailed Mr. Heffner a few times.
I know that he must be busy, however, I would like to know if he received my emails, resume and cover letter.
I know you have been kind enough for the connection, I was wondering if you could help me find out if Mr. Heffner did receive them.
I wanted to thank you again for your time and your help.
