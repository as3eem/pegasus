Dear Mr. Lay,  My manager and I were discussing the possibility of doing a fund raiser for Enron.
We contributed an absorbant amount of money to charities this year and last, would it not be possible to raise money to help our company.
Do a little belt tightening.
We could do without the Christmas party, do without our bonuses and next year at this time, when we are back on top, it would be a sweeter glory knowing that the employees helped turn everything around.
I have spoken with my HR rep and several other employees about this possibility and we feel that we would be able to raise a substantial amount of money.
Please let me know what your view on this would be and we will work on what steps we need to take to make it happen.
Thank you for your time.
