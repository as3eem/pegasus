Julia,  On Garden State matters, how do you want to handle the signing of documents?
Currently, I have been receiving documents from outside counsel and  initialling them before signature.
Based upon Hoyt's email below, there may  be a desire to have a more expeditious process.
I would suppose the answer would depend on how heavily our legal department  is going to be involved in GSP work.
Given our discussion last week, I would  not think that there would be a desire to deviate significantly from the  standard Enron process, but it is not my call.
I would appreciate your thoughts.
Michelle
