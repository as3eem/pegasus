Everyone,   I have attached the preliminary schedule for tomorrow's test of the integration test scripts.
For those individuals, who have been identified to participate in the test and are unable to attend at your scheduled time, please send me the name of your substitute as soon as possible.
The current schedule allows plenty of time for each step.
If the test is ahead of schedule, we may call you in at an earlier time.
Thank You,
