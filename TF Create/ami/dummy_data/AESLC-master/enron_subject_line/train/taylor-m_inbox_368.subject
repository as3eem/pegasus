Hello -  I was searching your website for capabilities on emissions trading.
I understand you conduct and enhance market information as well as establish custom solutions that enable environmental compliance.
I was wondering if you an provide some information on your services, and what the current trends are for SOx and NOx emissions trading.
How does Enron participate ?
Most importantly, I was wondering if you have available data on cost savings for Enron itself as well as others in the industry.
Thank you for your help - I look forward to your reponse.
Sincerely,
