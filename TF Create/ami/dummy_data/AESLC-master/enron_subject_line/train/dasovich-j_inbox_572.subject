Jeff,  My colleague Joel Schwartz and I are looking for a concise summary of the typical siting/permitting process for a plant in California, including steps in the process, number of agencies, and average length.
Any ideas?
Thanks again for your great remarks last Friday; I really appreciated them.
Regards, Lynne
