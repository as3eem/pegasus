Tom has extracted the crude trades from Clayton's database.
A spreadsheet is available in O:\Research\Common\From_BobLee\crudewti.eol.get.
We are working on a cleaner version, but this should allow everyone to get a view of the data we have.
The attachment below has a description of the data fields in the spreadsheet.
If you have ideas on how we should analyze this, let Tom or I know.
