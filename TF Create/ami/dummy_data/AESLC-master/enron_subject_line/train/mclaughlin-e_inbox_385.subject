Frank, 	Just wanted to let your area know as soon as possible that I was placed into a Standby status for call up to Active duty.
I found this out over the weekend, my reserve unit was unable to provide me any type of time table of when I may be called be recalled or what the likely hood of this happening actually where.
Last time I had talked to you, you mentioned that Enron was in the process of revamping their policies related to these types of matters, I know that you answered some questiones I had but is there anything that gives a complete rundown of what the total policies are?
If so can I obtain a copy?
