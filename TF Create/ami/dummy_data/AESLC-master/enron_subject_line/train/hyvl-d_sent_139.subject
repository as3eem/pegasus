Doug,  As we discussed, Larry Pardue has requested that I get you to sign an  officer's certificate regarding the execution and delivery of the Fuel Supply  Agreements.
The document that he forwarded to me does not define the  agreements that he wants you to certify as to.
They are vaguely referred to  as Transaction Agreements which have been delivered.
As far as I know, he  may be wanting a certification as to the Consent documents.
If they get back  to me, I will request that they modify the document to reflect the Fuel  Supply Agreements only and that you are not aware of any reason why they  would not be valid under New York law, that you are not aware of any lawsuit  threatened against EPOS as a result of it entering into these Fuel Supply  Agreements and that so far as you know, EPOS is not an investment company as  such term is defined.
I will let you know what Larry is able to modify.
