How amazing is this story.
I worked with the father, he was an old H&Q guy and if anyone remembers, he is the one I used to smoke cigarettes with in his office.
I am sure you remember when I went out to his funeral.
Anyway, this story shows you just how amazing Rudy is after everything that has happened.
