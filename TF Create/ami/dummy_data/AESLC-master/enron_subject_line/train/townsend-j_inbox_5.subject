Judy, It was nice talking with you today.
Congratulations on your job with UBS.
My  specialty is focused around the trading operations, but the presentation I have  attached shows other positions we work on.
If there is anything I  can do for youor someone you know, please  let me know.
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you in the  future.
Sincerely,
