Hey Sally-  This note got kicked back to me when I tried to send it to  you yesterday, so hopefully it will make it through this time.
Thank you for your wonderful letter explaining your  decision to stay and display "visible leadership" during this very difficult  period.
I read an excerpt of it to the group, and everyone's hearts were with  you.
You were greatly missed, but of course we all understood and supported your  decision.
It was wonderful meeting you and I thank you for your  wonderful contributions to the first session.
I hope once things stabilize a bit  you'll have a chance to re-engage with the group.
