Hi Mr. Lay,   I just wanted to say how much I appreciate your gesture regarding the $60 million.
It has been a true pleasure working for a man with such integrity and geniune concern for his employees.
My heart goes out to you as I can't begin to imagine the sense of loss you must be feeling.
I am however, aware of our (your employees) loss, as I'm sure we will never again experience someone of your character and magnitude.
God Bless.
Sincerely,
