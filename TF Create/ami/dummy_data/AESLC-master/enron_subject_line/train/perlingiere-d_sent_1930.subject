Paul,  A fully executed agreement will be placed in the mail today  for your  records.
However,  Enron Corp.'s guaranty  has not been included as I await  signature from the corporate office.
Upon receipt of same,  I will send an  original for your records.
Please do not hesitate to give me a call if you have any questions or I can  be of further assistance.
Regards,
