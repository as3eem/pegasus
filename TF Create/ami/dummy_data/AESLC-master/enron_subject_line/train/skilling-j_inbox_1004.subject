Just wanted to let you guys know that Geoff unsubscribed from our Betas yahoogroup today.
He did not re-subscribe with another email address.
I'm only speculating now, but his email address was with TWA and we know that TWA was acquired by American Airlines, and the airlines are a mess right now.
So, if you know of any other contact addresses with Geoff, get in touch with him and let us know how we can keep him in the loop.
Geoff spent many years in the USAF, so hopefully he's not heading into some covert operation in Afghanistan.
stay in touch with the brothers.

[smu-betas] keep on the lookout for Geoff Anderson
