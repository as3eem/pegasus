I believe Jeff Bartlet will be seeking your approval to the standstill provision in the above agreement.
I just wanted to make sure that you are aware that Enron Corp. as an affiliate of ENA would be bound by the provision, since (i) it will have access to the confidential information or (ii) if it takes any of the actions prohibited by paragraph 5 of that letter at the direction of ENA.
Please let me know if you have any questions about this.
