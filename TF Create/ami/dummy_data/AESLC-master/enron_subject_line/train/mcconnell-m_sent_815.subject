Richard,  Hello from South America.
I am forwarding this email from John regarding  the J-Block problems.
Have you been involved in this?
What are your  thoughts?
If you have any ideas or can provide with some help, please  follow-up.
This is confidential but i thought you could help.
When he  mentioned this, I really couldn't remember much.
Amazing how the memory  fades on some of the details in just a few years.
Mike
