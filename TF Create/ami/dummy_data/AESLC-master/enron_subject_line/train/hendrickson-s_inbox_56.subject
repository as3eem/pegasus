I AM SOOOOO COLD!!!
It turned cold and wet last friday, just in time for our party on Sat eve.
We still had the party at our new building, inside the living room area with all the windows closed and a small heater going.
It#s impossible to believe it'S june!!!
So how was your weekend?
today is a holiday here but of course we are working.
