I have submitted the security requests to get the three of you access to the  "Other Agreements" subdirectory of the Financial Agreement Database.
That  approval usually takes about a day, as soon as it comes through I'll let you  know.
You will of course, still need to solve how to get into the directory  with Mike Neves.
Let me know when you can get in.
