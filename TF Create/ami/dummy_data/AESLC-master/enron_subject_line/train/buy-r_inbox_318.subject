Everyone,   Paul Flack called from the courthouse at 3:40.
The Judge had taken a break, and they were to reconvene in a few minutes.
Paul said it was going well, but would likely last for some time longer.
Apparently there are around 50 lawyers in the court room.
I will send you an email as soon as the hearing is concluded, or, if I receive another update from the courthouse, I will pass that along as well.
In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call me if you need to.
