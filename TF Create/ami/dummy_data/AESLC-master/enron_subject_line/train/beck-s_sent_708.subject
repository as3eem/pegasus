This is the note that I mentioned that I sent to Philippe today about space  in the new building.
You can take up the cause with Philippe when he  returns.
I am meeting with Tammy Shepperd at 1:30 tomorrow on some space  planning details.
I will tell her that Sheri's group should be located with  yours, and by that time I should be able to tell her that Sheri's group will  be reporting to you.
I will call you tomorrow after I talk with Sheri - should be by 11:00 am.
