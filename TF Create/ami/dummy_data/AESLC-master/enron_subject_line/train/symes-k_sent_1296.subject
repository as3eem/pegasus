Les - Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names.
I've  tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks  like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit.
I.E.
Navajo can  originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power.
If you could add these unit names  into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be  much appreciated.
Thanks,
