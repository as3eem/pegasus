Hi- This afternoon at 5pm I have a  conference call with moderators from forums 1,3,5 along  with Johnny Duncan  to determine  draft order for upcoming Forum draw.
J. Hines has agreed  to head the selection of the new Forum as  his Forum is not going to participate.
My understanding  is that your Forum  would pass on this draft as well ...our goal is that by next year all Forums  would  have 9-11 members with 10 as a norm target... according  to my records you should be there by  participating in next years draft...I believe this will  leave 7-8 for the new Forum along with 1 or 2  veterans to form its nucleus..Please email me if you  have any thoughts that are contrary to my thinking  or if you wish to be on the call, please notify me or  Vivian asap....   Craig
