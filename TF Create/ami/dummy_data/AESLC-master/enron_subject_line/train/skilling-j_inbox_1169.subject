Dear friends and colleagues,  All Europeans have been following the horrific events taking place in the US over the last few days and we are all extremely shocked by this tragedy.
We would like to extend our deepest sympathy to all Americans and sincerely hope that none of you (or relatives/friends/colleagues) has been terribly impacted by these events.
We are also very comforted when seeing American's determination, strength and confidence in the future.
