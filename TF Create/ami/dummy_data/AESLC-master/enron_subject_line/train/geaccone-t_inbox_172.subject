A few people have requested the agenda for the offsite tomorrow and Friday.
We had originally intended to distribute it at the meeting tomorrow, but here it is!
PLEASE NOTE THAT WE START AT 8:30 BOTH DAYS.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
If you need directions to the San Luis Hotel in Galveston, please call Sharron Westbrook or me.
Thanks!
