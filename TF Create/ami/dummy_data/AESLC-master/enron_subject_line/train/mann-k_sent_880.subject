Matt, Since so much of this related to tax, I thought you should have a look  at it.
Rusty/Fred, I'm not sure of the context of the presentation of the  information.
Is this something which is going to the public, or to the  governmental entity involved?
If there is something which will be  distributed to the public, then we should consider having Enron's PR group  bless it.
