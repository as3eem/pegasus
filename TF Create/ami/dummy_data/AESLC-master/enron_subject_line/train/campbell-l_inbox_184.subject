Dear Larry Campbell: All of us at Datek share with the country the sense of extreme loss  and shock created by the terrorist events that happened earlier this  week.
It was a defining moment in U.S. history.
As the time of healing  begins, Datek joins all Americans in extending our sympathies to the  victims and their families, and in supporting all efforts to make this  country whole again.
Rest assured that your Datek account and the capital market system is  secure, and that the assets you have invested with us remain fully  protected.
Datek stands ready to serve your needs when the U.S. equity  markets reopen in the next few days.
On Tuesday, we shut down our call center shortly after the New York  attacks.
