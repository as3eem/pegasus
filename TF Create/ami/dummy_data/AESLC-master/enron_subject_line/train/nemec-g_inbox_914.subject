Bruno,  Julie Gomez relayed your concern regarding the last sentence of Article II, Section 2(a).
I have revised the sentence as you requested.
Please forward 2 executed copies of the LOI to Julie, whereupon she  will sign and return you a fully executed version.
Thanks for your assistance.
Looking forward to working with you on this matter.
