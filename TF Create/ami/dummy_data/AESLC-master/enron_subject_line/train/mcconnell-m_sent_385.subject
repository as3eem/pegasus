Pelt,  Howdy from Houston.
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.
I took the week  off and it was what i needed.
I have been working at a hectic pace and was  on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.
I needed  the break.
My international traveling is over for the year, thank God.
