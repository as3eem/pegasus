Joe, EnronOnline is essentially the internet distribution channel for our gas  and power business.
Rather, my focus on the legacy channel is an attempt to  increase the probability that more originators can complete transactions and  generate deal flow.
As well, to reduce the conflict between the trading and  origination organizations in order to keep us spending more time in the  market than focused on internal issues.
As far as specifics, you will have  to wait and see.
Thanks
