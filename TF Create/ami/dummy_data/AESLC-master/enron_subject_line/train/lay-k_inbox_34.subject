Ken,  I've sent your letter to the Governor and top legislators.
I'm also working with David Freeman in the governor's office as well to try to keep sce out of bankruptcy.
It's unfortunate that government doesn't work more like business.
There seems to be no sense of urgency in finding the facts to make an intelligent decision, just people who don't want to make any decision even to do that.
On a side note, Propel develops software that makes it much easier to develop 24x7 mission critical systems including very advanced data management.
Is there someone who you'd recommend I can talk with on the energy trading side of enron to explore the potential of our helping you make your systems more reliable/scalable/easier to maintain?
Thanks!
