Good Morning Friends!
In an effort to update my Christmas mailing list, I would like for you to email me your current mailing address.
(also, if you have a personal email address, please include it too) It is that time of year again, and I would love to make sure each of you receive your cards!
At some point today, would you mind sending me your info - as I will be on vacation through Friday.
I appreciate it and am looking forward to the holiday season!!!
Have a great day!
