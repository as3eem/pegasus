To those still on the list serv for the Houston Heights Association - my apologies for the barrage of emails that you have received over the deed restriction note from Monday night.
The list serv was set-up so that you could receive messages about community news and events.
It was not intended to be used as a chat line.
All postings to the list serv email address - announcements@houstonheights.org - have been closed, accept for message from me, the webmaster (assuming I have reconfigured it correctly).
Any future announcements will go back to it;s original intended use.
Thank you for your patience and again, my apologies.
Debbie Markey, HHA webmaster
