Chris/Louise =20 While our obvious near-term priority should be to execute trading agreement= s with key CPs and jumpstart our trading, it seems to me another high prior= ity should be to try to leverage UBS' investment banking/lending relationsh= ips to uncover incremental, near-term origination opportunities.
Given the=  many financial challenges facing the sector, in particular the merchant ge= neration sector (sinking share prices, capital squeeze, shoring of balance = sheets, etc.
), I think there are probably some interesting value plays we c= ould tap into combining our commodity skills with the financial services of=  UBS Warburg.
You've probably already covered this, but I was thinking tha= t a strategy meeting in the near future with some of their folks in Stamfor= d would make sense in order to assess what low-hanging fruit there might be=  within their investment banking/lending relationships.
This might be a me= ans for our origination group to deliver greater value to the bank than wha= t we could otherwise be able to accomplish given the startup leadtime and i= nternal risk constraints we will likely face.
I would be very interested i= n discussing this further with you.
