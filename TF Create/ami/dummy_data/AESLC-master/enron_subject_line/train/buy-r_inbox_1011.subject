As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.
One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.
It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.
Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:  		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**  October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview         November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
