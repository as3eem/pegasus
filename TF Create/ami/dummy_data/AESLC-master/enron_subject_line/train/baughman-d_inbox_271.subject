Don...  Chuck  updated me on the status of our discussions re.
trading and creating a  TradersNews Energy product on EOL.
I fully understand  that corporately, you have a lot on your plate right now and we will be  patient.
I would like to meet with you in a few weeks when the dust  settles a bit.
I do have a one  quick question....  My sources indicate that Enron has agreed to place a  Megawatt-Daily Cinergy Hourly product on EOL within 2 weeks.
Is this a  true statement?
