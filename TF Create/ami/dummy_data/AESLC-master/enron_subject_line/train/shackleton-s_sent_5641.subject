Anna:  I just received your voice mail.
The package (including the Enron Corp.  guaranty) has already gone out via Federal Express to your attention.
You  should receive it tomorrow.
Also, Enron North America Corp. would like to assign the agreement to Enron  Credit Inc. (a Delaware corporation).
Would you like for me to prepare the  assignment or shall I?
Please advise.
Thanks.
