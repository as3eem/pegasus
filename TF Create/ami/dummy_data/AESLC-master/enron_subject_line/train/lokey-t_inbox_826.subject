For those of you who saw the two big trucks, rescue vehicle and ambulance at my house on Sunday and the many of you who have asked: Thank heaven, all is well!
One of my tenants left something on the stove to run to the store, and then decided to make another prolonged stop.
The other tenant, the only one home at the time, smelled something "really bad" as she was leaving to meet  friends and called the fire department.
Firefighters (a total of four vehicles) arrived in something incredible, like five minutes!
Thanks to her, only the chicken and the pot were casualties.
