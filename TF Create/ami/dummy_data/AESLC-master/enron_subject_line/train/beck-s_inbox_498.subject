Hi Ladies,  I hope the meeting on Saturday was interesting and  informative for you.
Ginger was concerned that so many people left at noon when  it was supposed to last until 1 pm, but I think we pretty much covered  everything.
In the notes I saw that it says "Awards, Yellow  Rose Petal, 25 hours over the minimum.
This is a new award."
I just want to  clarify that it is an award that our chapter asked for and is not a nation wide  award.
If you want to have it, your chapter will have to request it from  National.
