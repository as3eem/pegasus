Due to a number extenuating circumstances, the deadline for completion of final allocations has been changed from this Friday, September 14th, to next Wednesday, September 19th.
I have attached an updated list of Key Dates for the 2002 Plan.
Please note that no other dates have been adjusted.
The due date for the full plan remains Thursday, October 4th.
Additionally, the Plan format files (in excel form) that are scheduled to be distributed on September 20 per the plan calendar will likely be distributed tomorrow.
It would be beneficial if you or your designee could attend the Adaytum user group meeting tomorrow, as Greg Adams and I will be discussing what is in the file and we will be reviewing the Plan Excel/Adaytum strategy going forward.
Thanks,
