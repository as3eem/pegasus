We are planning the next NETCO test, a regression test next week for Netco.
Please review the names attached of who is scheduled to participate, and revise if necessary.
It will be based on EOL deals flowing, and a subset of EnPower/ SItara/ TDS deal entry with the new data (Intercompany, Gas Sale, Power Supply).
Monday - global setup, deal entry Tuesday - downstream, Unify, SAP   In addition, please review the attached test schedules.
More detailed information to come, but wanted to get preliminary information back as to participants.
