Jeff, this morning I spoke with Reliant's regulatory counsel, who called me  after talking with Lee Hart, and who seemed eager to look into drafting a  filing.
I would be happy to talk with Leonard Foster or June Suwara at  Sempra about doing the same, but somehow think Sempra might be a tougher  customer (don't know why I would think that...).
My suggestion is that we  work through Ms. Katz initially.
Anticipating that we might encounter some  inertia at Sempra's regulatory dept.
