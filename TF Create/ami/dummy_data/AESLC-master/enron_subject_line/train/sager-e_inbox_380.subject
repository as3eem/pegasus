Elizabeth - Can you please have one of your attys forward a draft of the power netting agmt to South Carolina E&G.
It is my understanding that trading will be curtailed (if not already shut down) until this agmt is in place.
Luara will provide your atty a contact to forward the document to.
Thanks.
