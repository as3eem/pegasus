I have not received any feedback from Edmund or David regarding the email  below.
Can you please respond as I am getting daily prompts for a response.
MUCH THANKS!
For Matt, your email stated that you trade over the IPE & NYMEX.
What rules,  besides the rules of those two exchanges, might apply to any on or off  exchange trades you might enter into.
For instance, here in the U.S. energy  commodity trades might be governed by the CFTC, where out equity options  might be governed by the SEC.
Besides the exchanges your email reflected,  what other governmental rules or regulations would govern trades you might  enter into?
