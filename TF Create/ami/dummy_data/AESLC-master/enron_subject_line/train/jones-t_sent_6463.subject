A little forward movement trying to get the Global Counterparty not to set up  counterparties under division or trade names.
If the counterparties insist  on doing so, we have been trying to get them to add the legal name as part of  the counterparty's name in GCP.
For non-swap team members, you may want to  forward this email on to your groups as well.
