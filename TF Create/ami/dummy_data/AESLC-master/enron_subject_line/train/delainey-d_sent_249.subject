Rob, no hi or goodbye - you are losing your Canadian politeness :)  On a serious note, you are doing the right thing for the company and for  Barry's career.
This will be a good opportuntity for him to get to the next  level if he makes it happen.
As you are aware, I will aggressively support you and the Toronto iniative.
Let me know.
Regards
