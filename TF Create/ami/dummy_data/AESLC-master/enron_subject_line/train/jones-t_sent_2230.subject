Attached are some of the new steel counterparties.
I need to give EOL  responses by Friday for all these counterparties.
In addition, we should  have more coming through, for a total of about 100-150 new counterparties we  have to approve by Friday.
I will need your responses, if any, ASAP, as I  still need to fill in Legal's approvals and return them.
Thanks!
