AOPA ePilot Subscribers, Please disregard the message at the top of this morning's issue  f "AOPA ePilot" that suggested that your AOPA membership was  bout to expire or that it was your last issue of the newsletter.
oliday computer gremlins conspired to erroneously send the  essage to most "ePilot" subscribers this morning.
Again, please disregard the message.
We apologize for the error  nd will work to assure that it does not happen again.
Thank you  or your patience and please have a happy new year.
Sincerely,
