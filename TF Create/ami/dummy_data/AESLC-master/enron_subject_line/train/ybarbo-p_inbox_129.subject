Hi Paul.
I received your message earlier this year and accidentally erased it.
When I called information to get your number, a really young woman (twenty-something) answered the phone number I was given....  She told me I had the wrong number but I'm still wondering...
Anyway, hopefully you'll receive this and reply with your current home number.
Are you still in Puerto Rico?
You'll have to tell me about your experience there.
Let me know if you receive this and I'll write back...  Talk to you soon...   Dana
