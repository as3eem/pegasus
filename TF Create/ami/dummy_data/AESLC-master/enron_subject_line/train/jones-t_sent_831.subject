I don't know what list you are working from for your approval of credit  derivatives, but attached is the list EOL sent me.
Many of the  counterparties on the list are London based credit counterparties, and I will  not be reviewing those, but I thought you might want to take a look at this  to see if it's jiving with what you're looking at.
When I'm done (probably  some time at end of the day since I just got the list yesterday and it's due  today!
), I will be emailing my approvals to Mark Dilworth in London.
