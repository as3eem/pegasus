Well, it's a little late, but attached please find the GTC deal clearing report for August.
Per previous discussions, the report lists all counterparties with 100 or more transactions clearing on online GTCs, 100 or more deals clearing on spot GTCs, and/or 30 or more deals on firm GTCs.
Please let me know if you have any questions or if you think these thresholds need to be changed.
Thanks!
