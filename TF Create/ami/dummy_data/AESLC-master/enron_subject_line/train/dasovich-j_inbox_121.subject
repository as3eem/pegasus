Jennifer --are you able to put together a one page update on where things are in California?
I need to give Ken Lay a brief update  his packet of information for a meeting on Thrusday.
Jeff Dasovich is terribly busy, but said he would review and edit an overview if you put something together for him.
Let me know if you cannot.
Thanks
