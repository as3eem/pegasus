Juantongia, per our conversation on this morning, you were unable to move Paul Y'Barbo's old extension over from the 3AC to the Enron building.
Because of this, we request you delete the old extension (x55855).
Paul will keep the new extension (x54173).
Thanks in advance for your patience and assistance.
Paul will leave a voicemail on the old extension (55855) informing callers of his new extension.
We are aware that this recording will remain for one month and will be deleted afterwards.
