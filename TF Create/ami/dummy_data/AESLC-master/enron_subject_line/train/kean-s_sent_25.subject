A "dedicated room" isn't as bad as it sounds.
It would not be in use full  time and the only equipment requirements are 4 screens (which one of the team  rooms can accomodate) and a network connection (which the team rooms already  have).
Let me know what you think.
Also: I talked to Salisha about Lara's  move and it's ok with me (I think we were originally concerned that she  wanted space we were setting aside for graphics, but she is actually moving  deeper into her group (and next to her files)).
