Gerald, our group for service contracts are still in tact.
Linda Harris, at 345-6488 or Jane Scelzo at 345-6489 can help you with this one...I think.
I do not see it listed, but it could be something pending.
Linda and Jane, he thinks one of the entities in ETS might have a contract for some work that's being done in the Gulf Coast Region.
Could it be an EE&CC contract?
Gerald will be calling one or both of you for your assistance.
Thanks.
