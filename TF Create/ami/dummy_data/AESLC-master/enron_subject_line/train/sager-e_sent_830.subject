Here are materials I recieved from EEI in anticipation of the EEI product  description meeting on Wed.
I would guess that the bulk of the meeting   will be spent on the "Into" definition, which draft was prepared by David and  myself, but we will also need to provide requested alterations to the other  product definitions (unit firm and system firm).
If you have any  questions/thoughts about the Into definiton, please call either David or me.
