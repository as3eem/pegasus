Today the Commission issued the following orders pertaining to transmission interconnection:  AEP -- Order granting rehearing on issue of interest on transmission credits for network upgrades (ER01-2163):  Commission reversed its July 26 decision in which it  refused to require AEP to pay interest on credits for system upgrades.
The Commission noted that it will be initiating a generic rulemaking in the near future on interconnection procedures.
However, in the interim, its policy is that "the addition of an interest payment in connection with system upgrades is appropriate."
