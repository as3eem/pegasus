Brothers,     Grumps ended up being treated for really nothing.
Once they got a good look at the artery, they found it only to be 30% blocked (had been 100% blocked the surgery before) and there's really nothing to do with that small a blockage.
So, it's really good news.
Guess those echo cardiograms aren't always real accurate.
It showed it blocked, causing the second procedure to be prescribed.
All for naught, thank God.
