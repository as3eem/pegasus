My dear friends (yes I want something): I have a proposal in front of Colin for the provision of services and wondered if you might get it back in the conversation at dinner in San Fran.
Actually in all seriousness, Stephanie mentioned that you're meeting with him and I thought you might be interested in seeing what we'd proposed.
Is someone in Producer Services also selling services to Calpine, or would it fall into your shop?
