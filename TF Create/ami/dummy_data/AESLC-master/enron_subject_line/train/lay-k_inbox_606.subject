Ken,  I wanted to send you a brief note letting you know that all of the agreements with the schools in connection with the Lay Foundation grants have been fully executed.
At this point, the programs are being successfully implemented on all three campuses.
I also wanted to let you know that Christie Patrick was a tremendous help with getting these contracts signed.
Her persistence and focus was wonderful.
Thank you for suggesting we work with her.
I also wanted you to know that Mike Kateman was a great help to us at University of Missouri.
Once again, thanks for all of your assistance and guidance with these
