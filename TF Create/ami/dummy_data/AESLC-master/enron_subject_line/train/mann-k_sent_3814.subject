Hi Theresa,  I'm not sure if Steve Thome mentioned this to you, but Enron is opening an  escrow account in connection with a transaction with Delta Power.
He  suggested that I forward the wiring instructions for the payment of the  escrow fee of $10,500.
Please let me know what other info you need to tee  this up.
Thanks,
