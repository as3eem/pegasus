Dear Jim:  I am planning to be in Houston later this month when two of my Moscow-based partners, Bruce Bean and Ivan Marisin, will be speaking there at a Production Sharing conference.
Once being in Houston, I would very much like to pay you a visit, remembering the invitatiuon you kindly extended to me when visiting our offices a couple of years ago.
Of course, I would also like to introduce to you Bruce and Ivan, both of whom do work in the energy field and in other areas Enron is active in.
We expect to arrive in Houston in the afternoon of Tuesday May 29 and depart in the afternoon of Thursday May 31.
It would be great if you we were to have some time for us, and I would appreciate it very much if you could send me a brief email and let me know whether a meeting with you might work out.
Independently, I will also try to contact Mark Haedicke so as to see whether I could se him again, too.
With best regards
