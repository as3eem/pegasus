Good Afternoon All,  FYI, I will be out of the office to attend a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning at 9am.
I will be having some blood work done so I am unsure as to the exact time that I will arrive at the office, but I will be returning immediately after the appointment .
Please leave me a note, voicemail or email in my absence and I will respond promptly upon receipt.
Thank you!
