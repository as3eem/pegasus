The Christmas Cards are in and I have gone ahead and merged them into labels for the envelopes for TW, NNG (North & South) Teams.
There are many wholes on the NNG labels and you may want to visit with the teams before printing.
I should have the labels here tomorrow, we have plenty of time.
Thank you, Ricki
