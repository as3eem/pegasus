Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:  This morning, WIC requested authorization from the FERC to place the Medicine Bow Loop project (pipeline and compression) into service.
We requested and anticipate approval next week, and assuming that approval, the project will  be placed in service late next week.
Under the terms of your Medicine Bow Loop contracts, the reservation rates and your initial first month MDQ's will become effective December 1, 2001.
I will update you on any developments and notify you when we have received and accepted the approval requested above.
For Medicine Bow Lateral Shippers, your MDQ's will proceed as set forth in your contracts, and you will see a reduction in your rate for November to 12.6 cents per dth (to reflect total MDQ's exceeding 350 Mdth/day) and for December to 12.0 cents per dth (to reflect the Medicine Bow Loop in-service).
Please call me if you have any questions.
