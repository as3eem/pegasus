With Dana's return to employment, I have updated the Origination Account assignment list which is attached.
All accounts have returned to the previously established assignment list with the exception of Monsanto and Cytec which will remain with Rich until Dana returns to full-time status in August.
I want to thank each of you - especially Karen, Rich, Dee and Ragan who took on the additional duties and responsibilities of managing the daily activities of these accounts over the past 4 months.
Our customers retained our high level of service and professionalism due to the assistance from the whole organization.
Again, I thank you for your efforts.
