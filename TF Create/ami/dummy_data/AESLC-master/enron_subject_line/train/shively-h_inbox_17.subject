Bob, et al,  Please forward all PEC/NS/Aruba related documents to the attention of Kay Chapman with the estate.
This would include all transportation agreements, binders, etc.
If anyone has a full set/copy of the transportation agreements, please respond to this e-mail.
They need to go on a plane to Chicago later today.
We need to ensure these documents remain with the estate due to confidentiality provisions with PEC.
As always, thanks for your assistance.
Thanx,
