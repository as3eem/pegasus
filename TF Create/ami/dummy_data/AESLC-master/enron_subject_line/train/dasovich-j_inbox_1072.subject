Does everyone have access to the O Drive / Public Affairs directory?
I'd like to keep an external contact list (PUCs, Utilities, etc.)
and any material we are creating (files, documents, etc.)
in this area so the entire team has access in case someone is out for the day.
To get into this, go to MY COMPUTER, find the O Drive and then find the Public Affairs folder.
If you don't have access, please let me know.
Thanks,
