Our new office supply house is Boise Cascade, and we just got the capability to place an order.
We plan to radically scale down the supplies we previously kept in stock, but we will maintain a rudimentary supply of the basics.
If you need an office supply that is not typically stocked or if you would like to see the catalog, please ask Mollie or me.
