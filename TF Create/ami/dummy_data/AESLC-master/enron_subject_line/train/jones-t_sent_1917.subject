Mike,  Jason Peters, who was a lawyer seconded with us from Andrews & Kurth, has now  gone back to A&K, but is still doing some work for us.
Is there some way for  us to get him access to the Financial Trading Agreement database?
He is a  lawyer, and is bound by client confidentiality with respect to all the  information in the database, so I don't think we need to worry about granting  him security access.
Can we get him access?
