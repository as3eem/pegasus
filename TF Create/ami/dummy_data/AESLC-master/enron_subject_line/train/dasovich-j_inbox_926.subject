With all the ongoing changes that have been taking place around here and the known fact that some of us will be going our separate ways, it is my hope that we can all keep in touch in the future.
I would like to put something together for the group, so please provide me with your contact information, so I can prepare the "Let's Keep in Touch" contact list for Government Affairs.
Below is the contact information that I would like to receive from each of you.
Once I have put the list together, I will forward it to everyone.
Name: Home Address: Home Phone#: Home E:mail address:  New Place of Employment (if available): Work Address: Work Phone Number: Work E:mail address:  Cell #:  Other Family Contact Information: Please provide current (or future if known) address and phone number.
Thanks to all!!!
