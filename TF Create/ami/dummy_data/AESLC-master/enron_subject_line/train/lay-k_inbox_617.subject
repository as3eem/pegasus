Dear Mr. Lay:  On behalf of Senator Bayh, thank you for the kind invitation to attend the "U.S. Energy Policy at a Crossroads: Alternative Futures for the Current Energy Crisis," on October 3-4, 2001.
The Senator appreciates your thinking of him, but unfortunately he has a prior commitment, which will prevent him from attending the forum.
Please accept his sincere regrets.
Again, thank you for your thoughtful invitation.
I wish you the best of success
