Good morning Barry,  Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your counselling will have to be this week or when I return.
Did Enron provide you with approval for a "Post Arrival Consultation"/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.
(So, in effect there are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and then there's the PAC).
PwC Houston is prepared to set up the "PAC" - they simply want to know if you received approval for it.
Thanks,
