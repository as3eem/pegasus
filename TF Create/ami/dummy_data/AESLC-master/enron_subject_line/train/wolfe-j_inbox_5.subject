Chris Walker will be walking down that isle soon.
We will be hosting a wedding shower for the happy couple on June 19th, 2001 @ 3:30pm in EB2601.
The  To-Be-Weds are registered at Bed, Bath and Beyond, and Pottery Barn.
I will be gathering a collection to get them a gift card and would like any donations to be made to me on June 15th.
Your contributions are very much appreciated.
Please send regrets only for the shower via email or contact me at the number listed below.
Thanks,
