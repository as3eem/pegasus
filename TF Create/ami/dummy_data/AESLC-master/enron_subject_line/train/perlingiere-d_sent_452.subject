In preparing for our meeting with Exxon, I have hit a dead end with regards  to the "Agreement"  he cites in his fax to us.
I have searched and others as  well to no avail.
Therefore,  would you ask Jacobson to fax  you/me  the  entire agreement he is referring too because it does not exist in our world.
Thanks!
