DCongel@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Market Participants:  In the early evening hours on 8/8/2001 the NYISO inadvertently ran a billing job for 7/16/2001.
This created a version 5 of the bills for this billing date.
Version 5 is not valid, all customers should use version 4 when reconciling their advisory statements to their invoice.
