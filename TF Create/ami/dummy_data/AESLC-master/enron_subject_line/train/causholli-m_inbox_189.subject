Monika -  I received some info today in the mail regarding a new master of science program in quantitative financial economics.
It is being offered by Oklahoma State University and they have a lot of money for financial support.
Perhaps you should consider it.
If you send me your address, I will mail the information off to you today.
Have a great Thanksgiving.
Jim
