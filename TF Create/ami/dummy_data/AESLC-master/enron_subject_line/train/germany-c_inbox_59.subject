Please check into deals 332163 and 340305 for sales invoices to Midland Cogen.
Max Doner thought these deals would not trigger activity anymore per your note to him on 5/13.
I see where these deals were updated by you on that date.
Are the deals legit, or are the triggers generated legit.
Please let me know ASAP.
Thanks  WRP
