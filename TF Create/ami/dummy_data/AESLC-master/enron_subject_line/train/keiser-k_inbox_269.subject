Kam, Kathy and Brian,  Concerning the ECC - Riskmantra logic that EOL has in place to convert the transactions that are done with counterparties with ECC master agreements...are we going to continue this way of booking (2 legs)?
If so, can you review the list of counterparties that follows the "2-leg" logic and let me know if there need to be any additions or deletions?
Thanks,
