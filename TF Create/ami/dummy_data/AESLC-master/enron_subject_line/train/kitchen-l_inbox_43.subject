Louise -- The Houston legal/regulatory group is working with the UBS legal department to obtain from the London branch of UBS AG a power of attorney which will expedite the execution of agreements and other signature documents involved in starting the energy trading activities.
(I will provide you specific information on the nature of this power of attorney as soon as I obtain it.)
To get this in place as soon as possible, we've been asked to provide backup information with sufficient specificity that the nature of each relationship/contract and counterparty is identified.
(Example 1: "Wholesale power trading master purchase and sale agreement with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing L.L.C.
and related transaction confirmations".
Example 2: We would specify the contract and counterparty for each of the 44 gas pipelines which we need to utilize for gas trading operations in ERCOT).
