Neil,  I would like to apologize for the confusion regarding Anshuman.
We have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his trip to Houston and there was a lot of confusion regarding the terms (given that I was talking to Sandeep every few days).
Currently, we expect Anshuman to come   to Houston for one month to work on the DPC  project (at Jeff Shankman's request).
The lawyers advised me that we need an L1  visa  for him, irrespective of the duration of  his stay.
Sorry for the confusion.
