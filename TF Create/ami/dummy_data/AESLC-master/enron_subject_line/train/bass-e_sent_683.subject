We are going to be rolling out a new product on EOL starting this bidweek.
This product will be for physical delivery only on the weekdays (no weekend  delivery).
Currently, the EOL/Sitara Bridge cannot handle this type of  logic, so these deals will have to be input manually.
Let me know if you have further questions.
