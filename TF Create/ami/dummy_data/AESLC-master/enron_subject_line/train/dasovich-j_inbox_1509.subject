I've been talking to other ESPs about the PX Credit Payment and the Barnett proceeding.
Some tidbits:  New West -- wants to keep the payment issues out of the proceeding and wil attempt to do that.
They don't have a complaint filed, so they need SCE to have good faith bilateral settlement discussions.
Good luck there.
Their meeting with SCE is 11/6.
