I thought you'd appreciate this email from my brother.
It's the best family  email I've gotten lately.
I'm such a great sister...I bought the present,  wrapped the present (or at least watched while the clerk wrapped it), and  delivered it to my mom for her birthday, and I was nice enough to put my  brother's name on the gift.
