Stan has drafted the attached response to Peggy Fowler's letter that she sent to Mr. Lay dated December 12.
I will walk over a copy of the 12-12 letter for reference as Mr. Lay is reviewing the attached document.
Once Mr. Lay has signed and mailed the letter, would you please provide Stan Horton with a copy for our files?
Thanks!
