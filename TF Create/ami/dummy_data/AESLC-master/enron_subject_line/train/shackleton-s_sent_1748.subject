Carol:  Hope all is well.
We are missing you every day.
(1)  On a "swap" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the  ability to post cash collateral to ENA.
Can you recall where we left off on  the issue?
I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon  the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty  as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held  in a U.S. account).
(2)  On a "credit" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception
