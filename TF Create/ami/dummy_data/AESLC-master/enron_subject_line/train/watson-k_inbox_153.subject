Dear All,     This is Youyi from Hong Kong who misses all of you.
I am sorry for not contacting you earlier because of loss of your contacts.
Everything is fine to me in Hong Kong now except for a big shock for the terror attack on WTC and Pentagon.
If you find out a chance of visiting Hong Kong, please give me a call at (852)2609-8242 (O) or (852)2994-3485 (H).
I will be very happy to have a gathering with you.
Cheers,
