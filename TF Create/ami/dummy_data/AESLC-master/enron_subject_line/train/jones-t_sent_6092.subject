The referenced counterparty is on the list below for online approval to trade  us gas financial products.
This counterparty came through before on the  1/20/00 list and we did not approve them for financial trading because of a  "payment dispute".
Is anyone out there aware of the payment dispute with  this counterparty, and has it been resolved?
Can we open this counterparty  up to trade financial?
They are an ESP...
