I spoke with Sylvia Pollan this afternoon in regards to Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership (SHORTNAME: MIDLANDCOGEN).
Although the counterparty terminated the 9/1/90 agreement 1/15/02 per the Master Letter Log, we should continue to moving the gas until further notice.
As result of such, please move the following transactions from the BANKRUPTCY book back to the 'Live' side (sorry, couldn't think of a better description).
I will send immediate notice should the status of these transactions change.
