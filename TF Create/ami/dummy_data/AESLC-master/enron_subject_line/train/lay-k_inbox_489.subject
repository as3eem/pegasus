Dear All,  Just to advise everyone that Liz and JL will be arriving late for Pop-Pop's dinner on Friday, October 12, because she is chairing an event that evening.
Her event is billed until 7:30 p.m. but due to the fact that she is a chair she won't be able to leave until it is over.
Therefore, we will not take the big group photo until they arrive.
Thanks,  Linda, Mom
