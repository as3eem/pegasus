COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION                         NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES                                 OCTOBER 01, 2001  Notice ID: 3144 5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED   SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123  Due to long-wall mining activity occurring under Columbia's Line SM-123 in Mingo County, WV, the line will be taken out of service.
Columbia anticipates this outage to begin in late October 2001 and run through approximately mid-November 2001.
However, the start date and duration of the outage is contingent upon the actual timing and progress of the long-wall mining activity.
Given the level of firm commitments in this area, Columbia believes that there will be no available capacity for interruptible transportation.
The following receipt points will be affected:     Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)                      Hi Hat            (F3)     CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)                      Conoway           (CNR03)                      Johns Creek       (CNR08)                      Canada            (CNR09)                      Canada            (CNR10)                      Stafford          (CNR11)                      Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)                      Briar Mtn.
