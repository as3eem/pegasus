Amy has additional questions from John Koomey:  1.
Can we change the wording in Section 3.a to "$2,500.00 per one-day course, plus the actual price of course books...  2.
Can we delete the last sentence in Section 3b?
(Examples of acceptable forms...)  3.
Does Section 5 mean Koomey can present his (math and calculation class) to other companies as long as he does not refer to Enron, does not use Enron teaching examples, and does not use use / disclose any Enron-specific information?
Thanks....
I'm printing these questions and I have pulled the Agreement for you to look at.
