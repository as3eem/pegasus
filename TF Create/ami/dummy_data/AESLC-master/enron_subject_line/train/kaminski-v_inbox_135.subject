Vince,  Thank you for being an important part of my business during this past year.
I am looking forward to continue our business relationship in 2002 and beyond.
We did strengthened our staffing practice in 2001 and had our best year ever, despite difficult market conditions.
Everyone on my team enthusiastically invites you to stay in touch with us during this new exciting upcoming year.
I hope you get the same opportunity I will have to spend some extra time with family this Holiday Season.
Thanks again.
