Hi Christian  Thanks for the email and voicemail - look forward to seeing you in Oct.
This EEI contract is a still a progress in work.
Last week's meeting  resulted in still more changes.
New draft is being prepared and will be  distributed later this week.
Contract "rollout" is in Nov.    Its raining here.
First time in over two months.
I think I'll leave today in  celebration.
Sager
