FYI, In reference to your memo of May 5th,  I prepared and sent a new Master to  Pan on May 1st.
Since then, I have trouble getting in touch with anyone at  Pan to discuss the agreement.
The treasurer  referred me to  Rick Tucker  (713) 331-5049.
He stated Pan is not ready to consider new paper, as the one  in place is working fine and not priority.
But would review the new  agreement when he had time.
