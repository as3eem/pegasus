Roger,  We regret that Fred Malek has decided to not pursue talks with you and Paul Portney about the RFF Board.
Thanks, though, for trying.
When the Nominating Committee met back in October, they also thought that Steve Rales and Frank Pearl would be good candidates.
Would you be willing to try to set up a meeting with one or both of them now?
Also, Paul and I will be in Atlanta on Jan 3-4 and would have time to meet with Walter Massey if he was available.
Please let me know how you'd like to proceed and how I can be of assistance.
And thanks, in advance, for
