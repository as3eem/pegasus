Dear Ken -  Please don't be heartbroken about the value of anyone's portfolio or stand in line to beat yourself up about it (again).
Contrary to popular opinion, there is nothing that Enron executives or Wall Street analysts can do to ruin anyone's future.
The "portfolio problem" is not loss of value, rather lack of values--people need to get some personal values that are worth a damn!
