Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that provides billing information for July 2001 reservation invoices.
Please be advised that the PG&E (Core) releases exceeded the maximum tariff rate as summarized below (the first three were special calculations based on index spreads and the last one was a fixed rate):  PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation           60,000/day * 31 days * $0.7081 = $1,317,066.00  Sempra Energy Trading Corp.                           15,000/day * 31 days * $1.9951 = $   927,721.50  Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.                                  50,000/day * 31 days * $0.7468 = $1,157,540.00  Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC        25,000/day * 31 days * $1.1600 = $  899,000.00  These amounts will be billed to the acquiring shippers and once payments are received, PG&E will subsequently receive reimbursement.
