Janette: I met with Mark Taylor yesterday and he told me that I needed to meet with  Mark to discuss my plans to return back to work in January.
Could you please  check with Mark to see how he would prefer to meet (office, lunch, over the  phone) and then call me at home (281-908-7122) so we can schedule something  in the next few weeks.
Thanks.
