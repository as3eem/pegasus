I am looking for one or two more interesting topics or presenters for the next forum.
Does anyone have any ideas or topics they would like to see covered by anyone?
Please let me know if you have any suggestions.
Bob Dussler is going to give an update on the Texans....and if Ken is able to attend, we all will want him to update us on the national energy situation.
We have had some great presentations...thank you to those involved!!
Richard
