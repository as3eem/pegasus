As it appears I will be living and breathing the 32nd floor of the Enron  building well through the first of the year, I've decided to break down and  try to maintain my friendships via email.
You all know me well enough to  know that this a huge step on my part ( I am not the world's best emailer).
Anyway, I feel like I'm out of touch with what's going on in your collective  lives and am thus missing out on some pretty wonderful, exciting and special  things.
So when and if any of you get a chance shoot me back a quick note  and let me know what's new in your life.
Love you guys,
