Question for NetCo employees: The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.
Hence, no start menu access to estate.
You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?
Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis...
This was sent by an IT manager, let me know your thoughts... O
