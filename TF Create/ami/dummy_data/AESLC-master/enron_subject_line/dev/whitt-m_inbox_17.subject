I spoke with Jill at the agency, and I will either meet with her later this  afternoon or tomorrow morning.
She basically just needs some paperwork on  me and I am then able to start working for you as soon as you'll have me.
When would you like me to begin?
This week...Thurs?
Just let me know what  you'd prefer and I'll be there...with bells on!
