hello in the last week we recived some mail with  the virus attached.
the virus is strange because one window was opening  automaticaly when we opened  the connection.
probably some mail  leaved from our pc with the virus attached (the virus is autoreply) but  nothing appear  in our  exit-mail list in this days we  recived  other mails with the some problem.
in this days we are checking  better our pc with one antivirus and for one week  we don't reply at any mail probably the name of the virus is:   Virus  W32/Badtrans.B           so,please,pay attention   and sorry for this  disadvantage best regardswww.zebramodernariato.com
