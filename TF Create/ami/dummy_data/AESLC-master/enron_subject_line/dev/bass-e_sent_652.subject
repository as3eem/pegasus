I am trying to pull together a report on the future of the gas market in  Texas.
I was wondering if you have a report that shows new generation coming  on in the next 3-4 years as well as a report that shows current generation.
The names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important.
The most important data is MW capacity as well as type of generation (i.e.,  natural gas, coal, etc.)
Do you have this information?
Thanks,
