Attached is the referenced list, with the following comments:  1.
BC Gas Utility Ltd. was added as an amended counterparty by me.
We got  the financial master in place with them so we are opening them up for all  financial.
2.
Ferrell North America - we have a financial master in place with  Ferrellgas, L.P., d/b/a Ferrell North America.
That should be the name that  goes out on the confirm.
