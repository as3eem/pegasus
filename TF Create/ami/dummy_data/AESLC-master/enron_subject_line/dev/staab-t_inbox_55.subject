Paul and Thersa, Needed to check on a couple of things before I get to far into November.
Paul - have you heard or seen anything from Gerald in the contracts?
I would think that the contracts would be a mode point at this stage since the deal ended 10/31.
Would you please check with your people and get back to me on the status of these contracts and documents still floating around?
Thersa - I need to know what the phyiscal balance for Young Storage is at 10/31.
Can you send me the balance and the Young Storage invoice for October?
I need to know the storage balance as soon as possible.
You should have that before the invoice arrives.
Thanks...Robert
