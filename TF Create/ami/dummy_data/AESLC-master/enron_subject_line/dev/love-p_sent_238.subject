Attached is the revised model with all of your transport deals from yesterday  and the farwell deal.
Please review and let me know if you agree with this.
If you agree, we will unwind/kill the TAGG deals and book the spreadsheet  amounts.
We are still working on the spread option and foreign exchange  being included in this model.
For the foreign exchange,  I took an average  exchange rate for the life of each deal for now.
Thanks.
