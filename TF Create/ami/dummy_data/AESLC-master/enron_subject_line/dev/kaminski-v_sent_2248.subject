I am forwarding to you a paper by some UT professors.
They approached us about the possibility of licensing this technology to us.
Under the nondisclosure agreement, we have to give them an answer in 90 days and tell them why we don't want to use it (if we decline the offer).
Please, don't circulate the paper to other members of the group without  letting them know that it's confidential and should not leave Enron.
In any case, please, let me know who else saw the paper.
We should make sure that the circulation is limited so that it does not leak out.
