Mark, 	Business Controls, which includes Corporate Security at Enron Corp, would like to conduct a security survey of Enron's offices in Denver.
I am tentatively planning on travel to Denver 10/18-10/19.
If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office it would help greatly in my planning.
In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.
Additionally, would you be my point of contact, or can you designate someone?
Lastly, if the above dates do not work for you, please feel free to suggest alternates.
Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.
