Just a reminder that we are coming up to the end of the year and that you will be able to roll over 40 HOURS or ONE WEEK of vacation time.
Should you have more that 40 hours please try and use them before the end of the year so that you don't loose them.
I do have a print out of the vacation time if you need to verify your current balance.
Thank you,
