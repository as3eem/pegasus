Mark:    A few years ago we sought California legal advice for transacting with  California cities.
We have an opinion from McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &  Enersen.
LLP dated 7/28/98.
Should we update this opinion given the increased number of cities with whom  we are sending draft ISDA's to?
If so, which law firm do you think we should  hire?

Due Diligence for California cities and governmentals
