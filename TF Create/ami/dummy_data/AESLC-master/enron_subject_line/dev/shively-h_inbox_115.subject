Danielle,  It's been over 2 or 3 months where we continue to experience problems with the new Market Data applet.
The problems are ranging from the instability connection to the IFinance servers to the price update delay.
Over these past 2 to 3 months, we kept getting hammerred by our business users (traders,etc.)
about these problems  and these problems certainly reflected really bad on us as the IT support group on the trading floor.
Rick Le has been doing excellent supports for us.
We are not trying to point finger to anyone in your group but we need to push these issues to Reuter's and let them know that these issues should be priority number 1 for them to fix.
It's our impression that Reuter's do not take these issues very seriously as the evidence showed that we don't have any acceptable solutions today after waiting for 2-3 months.
As we move to the new building next week, we will display the Market Data in more than 30+ plasma workstations.
The aboved mentioned problems will definitely make support very difficult.
If these problems are not fixed in the near future, we may have to seriously consider other options.
With the telerate version of the market data being more stable than the new Market Data applet, we may have to go back to use it.
Would you please help us provide better IT support to our business users.
Thanks,
