Special Greeting   Subject: PRESIDENTIAL BUSH'S SPECIAL CHRISTMAS GREETING               "Christmas is a time of wonder and joy, of generosity and peace, that brings family and friends together in celebration and song.
We sing old hymns and familiar carols, we show love for others in the giving of gifts, and we observe the hallowed traditions that make the season special.
This year in the midst of extraordinary times, our Nation has shown the world that though there is great evil, there is a greater good.
Americans have given of themselves, sacrificing to help others and showing the spirit of love and sharing that is so much a part of the Christmas season.
According to the Gospel of Luke, two thousand years ago, the savior of mankind came into the world.
Christians believe that Jesus' birth was the incarnation of God on earth, opening the door to new hope and eternal life.
At Christmastime, Christians celebrate God's love revealed to the world through Christ.
And the message of Jesus is one that all Americans can embrace this holiday season -- to love one another.
