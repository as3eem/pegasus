Oh my gosh!
Just found out right after I got off the phone with you that I am no longer going to see Madonna.
We couldn't give the guy a definite yes and he had to go ahead and sell the tickets.
Yikes.
I think I am going to kill myself.
Was it bad luck talking with you??
Ha!
Ha!
Anyway, I enjoyed talking with you!
Have a good time in S. Carolina this weekend!
