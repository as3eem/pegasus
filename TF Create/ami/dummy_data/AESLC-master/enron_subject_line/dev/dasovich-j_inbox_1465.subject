You may have heard, it may be a surprise We're making a move, and we're hoping it's wise...
It was hard to decide to go or to stay But MyFamily.com has lured us away.
It is a pretty cool gig as far as dot-com's go The only catch is that it's based in Provo  No, not Provo Spain, as some might guess The Provo in Utah where they drink much less  The land of mountains and rivers and BYU And of course the Olympics of 2002!
So please come and see us whenever you can We'll have plenty of bedrooms and a whole lot of land!
We'll snowboard and ski, we'll hike and we'll bike See you in Utah!
TJ, Theo, Lisa and Mike.
