Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships      NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. <ENE.N>, the embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by U.S. regulators.
Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division.
Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with Enron.
Shares of Enron were trading down 5 cents or .55 percent at $9 on the New York Stock Exchange.
