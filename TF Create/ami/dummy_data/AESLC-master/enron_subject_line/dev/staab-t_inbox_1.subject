Hi Theresa,  I just got through redrafting for October to pull in the new storage volumes and prices.
It looks like there are three new demand charges.
I don't really understand since the last email you sent said you had to reduce the demand charge.
If these demand charges are valid then we would need to send out a revised manual invoice.
Let me know either way.
Thanks!
