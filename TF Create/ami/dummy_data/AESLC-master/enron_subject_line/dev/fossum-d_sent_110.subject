I just talked to Frank about my revised draft of the rehearing request.
Susan, you will be pleased to learn that he has successfully talked me out of  starting world war 3 with the FERC.
I've asked Frank (and Steve) to massage  the draft to avoid a frontal challenge to FERC's disclosure policies and then  to work with you to get it finalized.
The plan is to carve out a limited  exception to the normal disclosure rules given that the Gallup case is over  and there is  no pressing need for disclosure in advance of the normal  discount report filing.
Thanks.
DF
