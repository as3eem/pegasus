Greetings:  Bowen's aide just called Mona and said that California State Senator Bowen is  going to have a hearing on MONDAY in California as a follow-on to the FERC  hearing that took place today.
We've been invited to attend.
Focus of  hearing:  Repeat of today's hearing, but have it California's house, rather  than FERC's.
Based on his Oscar-winning performance at today's hearing,  Steve Kean's the one Bowen's office has requested.
Possible to have a very quick call to get folks' view on the pros and cons of  participating in the hearing---recall that Peace sits on Bowen's
