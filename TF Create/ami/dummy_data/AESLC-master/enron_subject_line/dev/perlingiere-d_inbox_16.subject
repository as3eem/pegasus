Debra,  I sent a hard copy of the GISB amendment to Kimberly Gentle of the above referenced company.
She said they executed the amendment and sent it overnight to us on 10/17 and it was signed by our mailroom on Oct. 19, 2001.
She called to find out whether we have received it.
I asked her to fax me a copy of the executed GISB but she couldn't find her copy and that's why she wanted to make sure that we received our copy.
Please let me know because I need to get back to her.
Thanks,
