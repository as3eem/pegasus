Scott and Bruce: I just sent you the revised documents that we received from ACE.
I spoke  with Bill Windle this afternoon and told him that it was unlikely that we  would be in a position to talk with ACE by 4 tomorrow.
He would like to try  and have an internal call with ourselves and you sometime tomorrow if  possible.
I'm going to be unavailable from 10-2 tomorrow, but could you  please give Leslie Hansen a call and let her know what if anything we can  accomplish tomorrow?
Thanks.
Carol
