Dear Marketer,  In an effort to ensure proper notification in the event of a problem with your gas deliveries and the EBB, we are reviewing the contact information for your Gas Supply Operations person.
Please forward the name, Phone number, fax, email, and pager (if available) of the operations personnel for both NY and LI.
If there are changes or additions to the information we have on record for the EBB, an access request form should be sent in.
I have attached this form for your convenience.
It is your responsibility to monitor the EBB and contact us regarding any problems relating to contracts and deliveries.
