Just a followup note:  We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original  incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have  been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of  using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).
I  think it would be  good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to  the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.
So my  question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts,  to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!
).
