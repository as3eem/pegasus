Cinergy going into summer long on power  Cinergy CEO Jim Rogers told Restructuring Today in a three-part interview that this summer prices will be low and electric supplies plentiful.
Is it the result of the June 1998 price spike that rose to $7,500?
Did the high price lure in generation that's now providing ECAR consumers with economical prices at a time when the West Coast is being punished for not doing the same?
"The short answer is yes," Rogers replied.
ECAR is getting 4,000 mw more capacity this summer, he added.
Rogers thinks the Ohio market will be slow to open and may not get robust for five years.
He was critical of other IOUs that are dragging their feet in RTO formation.
