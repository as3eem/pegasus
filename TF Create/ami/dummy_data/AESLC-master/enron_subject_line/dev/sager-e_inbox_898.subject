Recipients: I also have been meeting with AEP's Into Product traders to discuss the implications of moving to the MISO.
Conceptually what we have been discussing is a "policy statement" of the "Best Practices" for allocating the rights, obligations and commercial risk as between Sellers and Buyers of existing Into Product transactions based on the current definition contained in the EEI contract in as much the same manner under an RTO structure as possible.
Separately from that transition product issue, but somewhat related, is a need to define on a going-forward basis the products sold within these emerging RTO structures on the first day of operation and as a market rules emerge.
I will endeavor to email a draft proposal Monday morning to this group.
