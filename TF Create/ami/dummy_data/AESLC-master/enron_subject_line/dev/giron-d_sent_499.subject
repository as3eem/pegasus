OK, so the classes start this week.
The first one will be on what to look  for in a P&L and MiniBench to prove reasonableness.
Will Kelly and I will  present the class.
We have a few items we want to go over, but I think the  most beneficial part will be individual questions.
So bring them if you have  them.
We are have split the entire Risk team into two groups.
Our breakout  is as follows:   Group1   Group2  Carole    Jennifer  Jason    Anne  Chris     Group 1 will meet this Wednesday @ 11:30am and Group 2 this Thursday @  11:30am.
We will have Chick-Fil-A for lunch.
Thanks.
DG
