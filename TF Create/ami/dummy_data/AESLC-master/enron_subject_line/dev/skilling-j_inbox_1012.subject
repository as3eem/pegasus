When Enbridge (U.S.) Inc. acquired Midcoast Energy Resources, Inc. in May 2001, Midcoast had over 80 pipeline systems in 10 states, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada, comprising over 4,100 miles of pipe, which were transporting in excess of 1.25 bcf/d, with total revenues of $800 million in 2000.
Midcoast had grown from $0 to $600 million in just five years in its industry.
So why did Dan Tutcher decide it was time to stop what Midcoast was doing and merge?
