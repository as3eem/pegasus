Steve, I only have the following suggestion for the Office of the Chairman  paragraph:   "Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.
Joining Dave, in the  Office of the Chairman, will be Marty Sunde, as President, Global Marketing  Services and Dan Leff, as President, Global Energy Services.
Dan and Marty  have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES  business model.
In addition, Janet Dietrich will join the Office of the  Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.
Currently, Janet is Managing Director  in Enron Americas where she had successfully led both trading and origination  organizations."
