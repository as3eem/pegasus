Hello!
For those of you that don't know...I've moved.
I finished two years with Morgan Stanley and have called it quits there.
I am now working for Thomas H. Lee Company in Boston.
Anyway, just wanted to pass on my new information...  Home: 90 Revere St. #2 Boston, MA 02114 (cell phone number to come...for now it's still my NY #: 917.549.4987)
