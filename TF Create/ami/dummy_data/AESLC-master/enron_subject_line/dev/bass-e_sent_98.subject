A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.
He really likes  a set already and wants to buy them, but they require a high powered amp.
His question is does the quality of the amp make that big of a difference  assuming equivalent power levels?
i.e for a given level of power how much  does the quality of the high end amp matter?
Thanks
