Tanya:  Our legal group would like to schedule instructional seminars covering the  ISDA Schedule, Credit Support Annex, omnibus and other forms and,  specifically, the credit issues which arise in the preparation and  negotiation of these documents.
Our thought is to eventually offer regular  instruction every other month but we believe that initially we should offer  monthly seminars.
In order to avoid "legal/credit Tuesday" boredom, we propose Wednesday or  Thursday as a regular luncheon meeting date.
How does the week of February  19 or 26 sound?
I believe that we can circulate a "curriculum" of sorts to  you or at the least a listing of topics.
Please let me know what you think.
As always, we welcome your suggestions.
