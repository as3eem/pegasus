This issue comes up when the Credit Group is not happy with the credit  provisions built into the already executed Master Agreement - they want the  ability to use the GTC with the credit provisions that allow us to call for a  letter of credit whenever we want to instead of having the online trade  governed by the master (as provided for automatically in the ETA).
What do  you think about Edmund's solution?
