Dear Erin,  On behalf of Jeff Skilling, the endorsement, name and title, as slightly edited for stylistic consistency by your manuscript editor,   look fine!
Again, on behalf of Jeff, thank you for your interest in him and Enron.
We look forward to receiving a copy of the book!
Let me know if I can help in any other way.
Best regards!
