Jim:  As a follow up to our conversation of yesterday, please note the following:  (1)  I have not received your comments to our blackline of EWEB's ISDA  Schedule.
(2)  I have not received your suggested language to the Deemed ISDA  confirmation.
Please verify whether or not you emailed these to me yesterday as promised.
Also, Holli Krebs has offered to try to organize a conference call to discuss  the Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.
Tracy Ngo from our credit  group and I will be available to answer any questions.
As soon as we have  your comments, I can provide you with a blackline.
Please let me know if there is anything further that I can do.
Thanks.
Sara
