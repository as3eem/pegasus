November 26th, 2001  ATTENTION ALL SHIPPERS/NOMINATING AGENTS AND PLANT OPERATORS:  Imbalance restrictions lifted  The restriction on nominations in excess of projected usage and imbalance payback gas has been lifted effective Gas Day November 27th.
Therefore, effective immediately, you can schedule additional volumes through the end of the month if you are in a current-month under-delivered position, or wish to schedule prior period imbalance payback gas.
We appreciate your assistance, particularly during these shoulder months when scheduling the appropriate volumes of gas can be challenging.
Sincerely,
