Hey Darren,  Just thought I'd let you know that Billy Lemmons mentioned you by name in one  of the Analyst/Associate brown bag lunches.
He was talking about the Ag  Trading initiative and who spear-headed the effort (I think the other guy he  mentioned was Jay Fitzgerald).
Anyway, thought you'd like to now you're  definitely making a name for yourself around here.
Hope things are going  well with you.
Talk to you soon,  Susan
