Karen,  As far as I'm concerned you have answered my legal questions.
I will add  that I think that it is the City which  has preserved its option as to who  repairs the road since they have approval authority.
However, this doesn't  seem like a big issue to me.
So long as the commercial team is happy with the minor changes with the risk  profile, I'm happy.
