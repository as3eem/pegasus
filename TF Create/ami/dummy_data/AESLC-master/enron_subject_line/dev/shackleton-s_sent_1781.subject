Tina:  Per my voice mail, please provide me with a copy of the confirm of the  referenced transaction booked by J. Aron in the name of ENA rather than Enron  Corp., expiring 12/08/00, settling 12/11/00 (collar, Strike 1.55).
Who is  monitoring?
ENA (and Enron Corp.) are being asked to execute this novation.
Thanks.
Sara
