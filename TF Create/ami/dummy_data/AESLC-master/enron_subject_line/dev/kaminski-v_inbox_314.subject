In a recent discussion with Walter Coffer, he stated that there may be an opportunity for a "shared savings" for a subscription to Restructuring Today.
He thought Restructuring Today was better than the standard power industry news offerings because of the investigations beyond just the news.
The URL for the website is:  www.enernetdaily.com/restruc.pdf.
Attached is an Excel spreadsheet which shows the break points for a corporate subscription.
If  3 people subscribe, it is cheaper to get a 5 person subscription.
If  30 subscribe, it is cheaper to get an unlimited corporate subscription.
Please let me know whether or not this service would be of value to you.
If so, send your accounting information and your email address so that all of the subscriptions can be turned in together to take advantage of the discount.
