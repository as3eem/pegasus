Please leave Wed 10/31 at 3pm open for a quick (15-30 min) presentation of this functionality to EOL.
I want us to make sure we know how to use the function and that the traders are aware of what it does.
Judy will get back to us with a location for the meeting.
Judy Please call Lindsay (with EOL) to get a conf.
room setup that has the presentation equipment for what she wants to do for us.
Tell her the invite list will be the above people.
Thanks, - Mike
