Teb, here's the proposed response.
I'm a little concerned with making a big deal about this.
However, I put in language which addresses the fact that the issue is outside the scope of the proceeding.
See what you think.
Elizabeth, I haven't heard back from you to get input on the final language.
Please look at the last paragraph and make sure I have said it right.
We can make a broader distribution after you both have had a chance to look at the letter.
Thanks!
