Hi Girls, I'll be Mrs. Susan Williams in 8 DAYS!
I'm so excited and nervous and stressed all at the same time.
This has been a hectic week not only with wedding errands but also trying to get my life wrapped up before I take off for three weeks.
Before I leave town, I want to make sure you all know what's going on  next weekend.
I think most of you (with the exception of Katie) will be  getting in town on Friday.
If anyone will be in Park City by 11:00 am on  Friday, I'd love for you to come to the bridal luncheon my grandmother is  having for me.
If you can make it, let me know.
Friday night I've got the rehearsal at the church at 5:30.
The rehearsal dinner starts at 7:00  pm at the Marriot.
Dinner will be very casual.
You may want to wear or  bring something with long sleeves because dinner is outside and it gets  chilly at night (low 60's) in Park City.
After dinner, it will be time to ditch the families  and head to Main Street where we will have our choice of two or three bars
