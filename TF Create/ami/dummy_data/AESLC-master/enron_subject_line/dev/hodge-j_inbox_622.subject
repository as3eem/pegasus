John, Just a reminder that Tiger is still looking to baseload a piece of gas delivered to WGL, on a firm basis, for the remainder of November.
We are prepared to pay a premium above where Transco NNY prices are trading right now (as of 11:15 a.m. on Nov. 5).
We would be looking to do a volume of between 3,000-5,000/day.
If we do finalize a deal, we will either post an LC with you, or prepay the entire amount by wire.
Thanks for you help,
