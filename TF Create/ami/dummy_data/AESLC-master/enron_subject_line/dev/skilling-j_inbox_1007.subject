Brother Betas,  I am George Pereira from the graduating class of 2001.
Justin told me of the Beta group and I was so impressed that you have stayed in contact for all this time that I wanted to join.
I'm now working in Houston where there is a nice conglomeration of recently graduated SMU Betas.
Do you'll have anything planned for Homecoming?
I remember last year that there was a big Beta tent.
