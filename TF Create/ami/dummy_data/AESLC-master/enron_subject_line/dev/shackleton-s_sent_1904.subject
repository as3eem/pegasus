Peter:  I know that Gary Rosenblum is out of town until after Labor Day.
Gary's voice mail directs callers to a gentleman with the last name of  "McFarber" at Ext.
6128..
I left a voice mail for him this morning and have  not heard back.
Is there a lawyer to whom I can direct questions about your  form of equity forward?
Thanks very much.
