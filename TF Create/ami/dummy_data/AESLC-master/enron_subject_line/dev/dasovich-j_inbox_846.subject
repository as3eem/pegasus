Energy Committee Members:  We have been offered an opportunity to benefit from a unique federal funding program.
Sure Power has been funded to implement distributed generation (DG) into a high-availability, energy-intensive application in the data communications industry (i.e.
telecom hotel, financial processing center, internet data center, etc.).
As you know, Sure Power is the world's leading supplier of DG-based systems providing six 9's availability (certified by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology).
Sure Power's patented technology eliminates interconnection issues with the utility, which has been one of the technical inhibitors to widespread adoption of DG.
Sure Power has already aligned themselves with EPRI to assist them with measurement and analysis, but are looking for a partner who has a potential project on the horizon that could benefit from Sure Power's technology and federal funding assistance (as much as $3M).
Please note, the project does not have to be past the internal approval stage to benefit.
Even a potential project that is still being analyzed for viability could receive funding for an initial feasibility study.
Understanding that the high-tech industry is going through trying times, and that many projects have been put on hold; Sure Power has a three-year window in which to apply the funds, so even a project that may not start for eighteen months would work.
The deadline in which to finalize their project package is September 12, so Sure Power would need to have a response from a potential partner no later than COB Tuesday September 4.
Feel free to contact Sure Power directly with any questions.
