Sara: I spoke with Mark about this and he was all in favor of having a party for  Marie although I got the feeling that if we wait on him to organize it it  won't happen.
Anyway, would you consider having a get together at your  house?
We were just going to limit it to the swap group.
Let me know what  you think.
