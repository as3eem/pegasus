Tim:  I got invited to an IEP strategy session time and place noted above.
I think it will give us an important opportunity to get IEP focued on our issues, including RTO formation, repairs to the CAISO, etc.
(I doubt I will get any more of a detailed agenda for a while.)
I also think this will be an opportunity to get IEP focused on Westwide issues, or let them know we'll be using someone else for such broader issues.
I am comfortable having I or someone else from GA  go but I wanted to give you the option to go too.
The other people they are inviting include both senior regulatory or commerical people including: Mr. Lynn Lednicky, Dynegy Bill Hall, Duke Jim Macias, Calpine
