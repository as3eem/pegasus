Gerald,  	I'm struggling a bit the O&M Agreement.
I've made some changes to the draft 	you provided last week.
Let me review the basics that we need to incorporate:  	- We are contracting to provide specifically the maintenance of the electric drive train 	   I'm expecting GE to provide that support but we need to have an interface that I expect 	   to be Hanover.
- Hanover may bid to provide the maintenance for the gas compressor as a separate 	  process with the customer.
Customer is currently expecting to perform this function  	  themselves & call in contract resources when necessary.
- ECS will need to reflect the cost and agreement and description of services to provide 	  us the "interface" between GE and Oakhill.
- ECS will need to contract with GE for the maintenance services and then decide if we 	  want to assign that agreement to Hanover or carry that ourselves.
I want to have these agreements set up to be executed prior to executing with Oakhill 	and contingent on the final execution of the CSA and O&M agreements with Oakhill.
Lets discuss as soon as possible.
Thanks 	mk
