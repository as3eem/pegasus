For those who receive your paychecks thru direct deposit, you are able to retrieve your deposit advice through ehronline.enron.com.
The SAP systems are down, however, so we are unable to print out the paycheck advices.
I will send out another email as soon as the systems are back on line.
Please check your bank to insure that your pay check was deposited.
If you have any questions, please give me a call.
