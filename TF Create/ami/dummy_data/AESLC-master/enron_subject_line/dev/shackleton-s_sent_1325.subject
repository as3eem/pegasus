Susan:  Attached are the electronic agreements for ENA trading with Goldman.
Not much to do here because we'll need only  a signature (get Gary Hickerson  to sign).
I have two changes to the Client Access Agreement which I will  give you to add.
We do not need certificates or our typical authorized  trader list to send back.
However, we will have to authorize password  applicants on Goldman's form.
How does EOL keep track of this?
We will have  to track because Harry Arora will be the password applicant (there may be  more) and I think he's still ENA.
I know that we will want to receive the  password very soon.
Thanks.
Sara
