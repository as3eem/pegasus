Join me at our exciting and informative seminar on Tuesday, September 11th focused on valuing your business.
This is the first luncheon in a three-part series on raising venture capital.
"What is My Company REALLY Worth" will address the mistakes founders make in negotiating valuations with angels and seed stage venture capitalists.
Entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to hear the panelists' perspectives on what early stage companies are worth in today's market BEFORE they get to the table.
Following this seminar on valuation, HTC will present "Series B and Beyond" on October 23 and "Closing the Deal" on November 13.
Registration and networking start at 11:00 a.m., with the luncheon continuing promptly at 11:30 a.m.
The program will begin at noon and will end at 1:30 p.m. sharp.
