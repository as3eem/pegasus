FCiani@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Market Participants,  Software changes originally scheduled for September 25, 2001 have been delayed.
Quality Assurance testing discovered problems which need to be repaired and retested.
The deployment of BEA's WebLogic application server will be delayed until October 16, 2001.
This server will be the platform utilized by the MIS to provide bidding and scheduling functions.
It will replace the current NetDynamics product and will be a more robust and reliable development platform for future enhancements.
New data postings will be available on the web to provide real-time internal transmission limits and flows.
Transmission line scheduled and actual outages will also be posted.
These postings are a continuation of the data requests made by the Business Issues Committee (BIC) in September 2000.
If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.
Regards,
