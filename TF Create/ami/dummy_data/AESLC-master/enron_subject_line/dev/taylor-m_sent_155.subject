One of the areas causing us legal heart-burn in the weather derivatives area  here in the States is the insurance and re-insurance company counterparties.
In most states there are different laws applicable to insurance companies -  most of which are regulated - including entirely separate insolvency  regimes.
Just another item for your radar screen.
