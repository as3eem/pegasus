Doug:  Thank you for your e-mail updating us on the Ripley Campus Grand Opening  events.
I have purchased a table at the Wednesday, April 11, HEART OF GOLD  CELEBRATION  luncheon at the Wortham Center, and my wife and I will be  attending.
However, I am unable to attend any of the other events due to my busy work  schedule.
Tell Angela I look forward to seeing her at the HEART OF GOLD CELEBRATION   luncheon on the 11th.
Thanks,
