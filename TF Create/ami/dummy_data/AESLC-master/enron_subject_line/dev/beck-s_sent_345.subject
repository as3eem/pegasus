To give you more clarity, Stephen transferred to EBS effective July 1, 2000.
His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it  would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on  July 1.
Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth  transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen  would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance  review being based on his work for ENA.
Stephen is very talented and will no  doubt do a great job at EBS.
During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his  heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct  reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our  other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.
It was his  failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs  Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.
It is the r elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that  category.
