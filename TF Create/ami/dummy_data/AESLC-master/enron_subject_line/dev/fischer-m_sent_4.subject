Tom,  Here are the new graphs with totals (bar charts) and distributions (boxplots)  for all seven sites through May 2002.
I believe that I have come up with a method of providing you with the  ESTIMATED energy lost.
Since it requires using two data sets (faults and  10-minute data) it will be take a bit longer to run.
However I hope to have  that result to you next week.
Mark
