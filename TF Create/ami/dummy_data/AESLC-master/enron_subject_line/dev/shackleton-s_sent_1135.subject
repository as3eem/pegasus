Susan:  The two above-mentioned projects are in the process of being  unwound.
The only confirm and the Master Swap Agreement for each are being  TERMINATED.
Will you please continue to follow up with Brenda Funk (in the  capital mgmt.
group with Scott Sefton and Gareth Bahlman) to get copies of  the "Swap Termination Agreement" for each and then enter the info into Lotus  Notes.
Thanks.
