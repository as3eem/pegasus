Hi Jim.
We have narrowed our choice of vehicles to two minivans: a Toyota Sienna and a Chrysler Town & Country.
Surprisingly, Ben helped us eliminate SUV's from consideration.
He prefers the smoother ride of the minivan.
It will be better for taking long trips.
The down side is he doesn't want to be seen driving a minivan once he turns 16.
Ha!
: )   We were able to help satisfy Anna (and Ben) by choosing a higher-end minivan that has many "bells and whistles" on it, yet still costs less than an SUV.
We are leaning toward the Toyota, even though it is a bit smaller than the Chrysler, because of its reliability and how it holds its resale value.
The Toyota dealer also has "$300 over invoice" sale on currently.
Plus they told Mark there will be additional financing incentives starting this Saturday.
Both the Toyota and Chrysler dealers have vehicles in inventory we can choose from.
So, we hope to close the deal with the Toyota dealer this coming Saturday.
What do you think?
Love,
