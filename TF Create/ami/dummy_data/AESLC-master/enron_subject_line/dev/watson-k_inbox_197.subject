WARNING:  Laptop AC Adapter Recall Program  This recall and replacement program only affects AC adapters on laptop systems with the listed Model Series Number (second list below), not the notebook computers themselves.
We ask that all laptop users in the ETS environment check the number on their AC adapter, and notify us by return email if any of the three model series numbers appear just under the COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION name.
We will centrally manage the replacement of your adapter to insure the replacement adapter is ordered and installed.
In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Compaq Computer Corporation announced a worldwide voluntary recall and replacement program for approximately 1.4 million AC adapters used with certain commercial notebook computer products.
