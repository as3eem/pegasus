All,   For those of you who have not met  with UBS's Immigration Counsel, Kumar Kuman, please review the attached checklist and forward to me the relevant information.
Whilst Tindall & Foster  (Enron's Legal Immigration Counsel) will be able to forward most of this required documentation, it would assist with expediting matters if you are able to forward me this information.
My desk location is 3681c.
For those of you who have signed the release forms  (copy attached) your details on file  with Tindall & Foster will be forwarded to Fragomen (UBS Immigration  Counsel) shortly.
Please utilize me as your contact at this point and not the contact names on the checklist until/unless otherwise notified .
Kind Rgds,     Karen   x 54667
