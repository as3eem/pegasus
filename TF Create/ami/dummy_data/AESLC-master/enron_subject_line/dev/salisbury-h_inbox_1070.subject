A final word on the new DMS procedure.
Mike feels it's important you know that Volume Management will thoroughly research each discrepancy before bringing it to your attention.
"Make sure they understand that we will exhaust all of our efforts before we send it over to them.
All notes will be provided on the DMS telling them where we are and what we found out and where they should look," says Purcell.
So when the discrepancy shows up in your file, which you will check at the beginning of each shift, it is there because our back office professionals have hit an impasse and require your assistance to get through it.
That means it's important.
Thanks,
