ECT Investments, Inc. ("ECTI") entered into a 5-YEAR credit derivative with  Deutsche Bank ("DB") effective 7/19/00 with a Scheduled Termination Date of  7/19/05 (Loews Corporation is the reference credit).
DB is requiring an  Enron Corp. guaranty.
There is no mention of guaranty terms.
[NOTE THAT IN  A SIMILAR DEAL 3/13/00 BASED UPON THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA  BETWEEN THE  PARTIES, NO GUARANTY WAS REQUESTED].
Should  ECTI post the guaranty?
Do we want a Master ISDA?
Please let me know.
Thanks.
