I'm in Houston this week and am available Thursday morning.
I would appreciate the opportunity to get together to discuss the intentions for disposition of the Sithe TCPL position.
I had figured that Geoff would value the pipe, take it in at a discounted position (paid for by Sithe with project equity), and then we would try to market it away at a higher value.
However, I have heard all kinds of different scenarios from within the company and would like to clarify this.
Please let me know if I can catch some time with you Thursday (June 7th) morning to review this.
Thanks.
