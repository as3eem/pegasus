As soon as I saw the problem (early Sunday morning), I left a Voice message on Jeff's phone, Prentice's phone and also a live message with the paging service for Jeff.
When it was time to determine what to do (i.e., the games were about to start),  I looked at the scores on Tennessee and Seattle and both were fairly high in the picks - Tenn ave. of 10.  so I figured that you must have meant to put 11 on one of your #12 teams.
I put the #12 on the team that alphabetically came first, put 11 on Tennessee, and lowered all remaining numbers to come back to 1.
(You did not have a 1 pick in what you sent.)
I honestly did what I thought you were trying to do, so I'm sorry if it wasn't the right thing.
Donna had come over to watch the game, so I couldn't really talk when you called the last time and even though you were trying to give me what you meant, the Seattle game was already over, so I don't think it would have been fair to change it at that point.
Did you have a marvelous time???
Did they like the tomatoes?
