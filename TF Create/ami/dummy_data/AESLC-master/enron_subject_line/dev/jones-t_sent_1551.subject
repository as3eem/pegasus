Alan & Harry  Since your group is the only other group besides the financial group that has  a product on the pulp & paper website, it is my intention to only send the  two of you their spreadsheets.
However, it appears the physical side of the  business (except for power) never says no, so if you prefer, I won't send you  the list.
It's up to you.
Let me know.
