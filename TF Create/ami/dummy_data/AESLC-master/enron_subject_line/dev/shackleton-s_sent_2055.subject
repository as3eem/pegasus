All:  I met with Rodney Malcolm and Finley Biggerstaff about the two 7-year  paper swaps between each of Garden State/CITI and ENA/CITI.
Who will be  handling credit for the new master and the transactions in general?
I am  told that this is a Q3 deal.
Thanks.
Sara  Molly:  I left you a vm about prior efforts to amend the ENA/CITI master.
Weren't ;you speaking wth someone at Citibank?
