Kim, Patti, Suzanne, and Ted-   The total burn nomination for month of January 2002 is 3,989MMBtu per day.
This is made up of the following:   1.
3,989MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ SoCalBorder (net, after PG&ENW losses 4,124MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);   Line loss on the PG & E line for January 2002 remains at 2.20%.
Our Broadway 3 steam plant (65MW) is off line for scheduled maintenance.
We will only have Broadway 2 online on a regular basis.
Our actual usage will probably be about 3,500 to 4,000MMBtu per day, unless the ISO instructs us to put Broadway 1 online.
If you have any questions, please contact me.
Thanks.
