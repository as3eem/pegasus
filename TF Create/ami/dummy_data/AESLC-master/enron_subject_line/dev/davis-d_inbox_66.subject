Hello Dana, Hope everything is going well for you.
Are you learning allot of things?
Well I had a question regarding a deposit you made, it's for $184,936.97 Hanson Production.
Did you sent that to treasury?
Did you give it to someone in particular?
It has not hit any bank and it was dated Oct 30.
Please help.
Thanks,
