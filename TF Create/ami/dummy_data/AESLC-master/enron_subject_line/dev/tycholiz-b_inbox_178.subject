Barry, I just sent out your stuff to get you to sign and return, and I       just realized I forgot to put a return envelope in there, (cheap       bugger).
My apologies.
I am just transferring it to a money market fund until it all gets       there,then I will do the direction from there, and I will let you know       which funds I think will do the job then.
Regards      Rob
