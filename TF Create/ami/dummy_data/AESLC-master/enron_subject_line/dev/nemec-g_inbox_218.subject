Hey Gerald, I was talking with Kenny Smith about LRC, and the people associated with HPL that went over with AEP, when I thought of a certain facility planner.
I looked at the Enron directory, and found that you were still with Enron.
I presume you're still with ENA.
Are you still working contracts with them?
I had a chance to speak with Kevin Kuehler a few months ago, and according to him AEP is busy relooking at all kind of possibilities (old estimates).
I don't know how long that kind of enthusiasm will last.
AEP will probably find out (what ENA already knew) how hard it is to make some good margins.
Let me know how things are with you these days.
