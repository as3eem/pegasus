Jeff:  I was actually on the phone with my Dad when I received Kenneth Lay's email about your departure, we both wish you luck and hope that everything is ok.
I have been working here as a consultant for the past month or two and have to say that I really enjoy the Enron environment, culture, and company that you helped build.
It really is an incredible place.
Regardless, I currently live in Austin and work here during the weeks.
If you ever get a chance, I'd love to hear from you sometime.
You can always email me here or my other address (wcarberry@sensecorp.com) or call me at 512-791-4709.
My Mom, Dad and I have always admired your successes and I still remember when we went tubing right after you decided to leave a sure thing at McKinsey to take a chance at this new merger-created company called Enron - what an amazing ride.
We do wish you well going forward.
Sincerely,
