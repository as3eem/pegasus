All:  For those people wanting to learn more about Var calculation and application, I've put a copy of JP Morgan's RiskMetrics documentation on the P: drive under \MidMarketing\RiskMetrics.
Of the five documents, Part 2 probably gets most directly at the questions that were being asked in Matt's seminar.
