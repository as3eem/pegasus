Dear Everyone,  I will be performing at Strings in the East Bay on Wednesday, October 10th.
It?s a homey room and extremely artist-friendly, so far off the corporate path that the owner doesn?t advertise or even publish the address on the web.
Of course, it?s not so homey that you can?t get a drink, and it?s close enough to the pulse that artists like Shawn Mullins still appear there regularly.
For those of you wary of crossing the Bay Bridge, it really isn?
t all that far (20-30 minutes), and this may be your last chance to catch my act this year.
Here are the details:
