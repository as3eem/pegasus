Ken,  Ben Streetman, Dean of the UT School of Engineering, tells me that he will be in Houston on November 14 and would like to meet with you.
I realize that your schedule is overflowing these days; however, should time permit, the Dean would sincerely appreciate an opportunity to visit with you for a few minutes.
Thank you.
