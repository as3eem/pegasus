How was the big weekend in Vegas?
I usually don't have to much luck at  gambling but I like to do it nonetheless.
Did you win any money on the  fight?
I had a blast the last time I went.
We stayed at the Paris hotel.
Very nice.
All those hotel employees saying "Bon Jeur" every 5 minutes did  get a little tiring though.
