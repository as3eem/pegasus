Midland Power bill is passed due for the month of October.
The amount is 90,148.57.
I told Roger Wieck at Midland Power a check would be mailed today or Monday, and please do not turn off the power to the compressor.
Mark Knippa said he would call Roger Wieck at 515-386-4111.
Karen Gruesen informed me that the payments have not been released by the Cash Management Team.
I would like to schedule a meeting on Monday, please advise when you are available so we can set up the meeting.
