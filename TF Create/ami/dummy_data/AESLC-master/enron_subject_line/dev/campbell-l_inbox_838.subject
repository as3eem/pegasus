DCongel@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Market Participants:  This is a message that will be posted each month as a request from market participants who attended the last Billing & Accounting Workshop.
The suggestion was to have a simple statement posted to the web letting each customer know that the last version for each billing day of the month has been posted.
In the future this will simply be "The latest versions of advisory statements have been posted to each customer's web site for the billing month of mmm/yyyy."
