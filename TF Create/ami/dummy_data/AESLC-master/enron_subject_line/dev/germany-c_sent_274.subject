ENA is set up as agent for Sithe Energies, USA, INC on CNG Transmission.
I  believe either Kate or Robin did a deal with Sithe last October.
ENA  released capacity to Sithe (only 500 dth per day), and acted as billing and  nominating agent on this contract.
It was a citygate sale  in New York and  we wanted to transfer title at the pool.
I received a call from Scott Nelson (212-351-0494) with Sithe this morning.
He is terminating the agency.
