Randy, I need your assistance with something.
Im trying to determine  compliance for all the EOTT crude oil storage tanks in the Midland Region.
Bill told me that you have a spreadsheet of the EOTT tanks showing some of  the tank characteristics (size, storage, date of installation, state etc).
Whatever you have, I would greatly appreciate your shaing it with me.
E mail  works best for me.
Thanks again.
