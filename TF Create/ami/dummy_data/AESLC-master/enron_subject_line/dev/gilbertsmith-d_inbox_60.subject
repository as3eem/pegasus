The estate has been working with traders in order to validate curves.
We are also talking with brokers and reviewing Megawatt Daily archives.
Can I get some curve information from the Ercot team?
I have three specific dates to verify:  11/30, 12/3 and 12/30.
We are validating the marks for the daily, balmo, the prompt month and the cals.on the above mentioned dates.
Do you have this information?
I have talked to Peggy at APB.
She is willing to pass on info on the dailies,  but the historical data is something they want us to pay for.
I dont really need help with the daily stuff,  just the dates listed above.
I would appreciate any help that you can give,  JForney Enron Estate Boy
