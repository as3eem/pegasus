Here is the GTC deal clearing report for September 2001.
I've included counterparties with greater than 100 online deals, 100 spot deals, or 30 firm deals clearing on GTCs.
I've also included a few counterparties under those thresholds because of the poor credit rating (those counterparties are highlighted).
Please let me know if you have any questions or need to change these reporting thresholds.
Thanks,
