Scott/Hedy/Mike: What's the status of the DG bill?
As I recall, Burton amended the bill in a  way that explicitly prohibit diesel DG units from helping California avoid  rolling black outs this summer.
I believe the exclusion was made on grounds  that running diesel would be too environmentally damaging?
Could you provide  a brief update?
Is there anything in the bills that addresses the  restrictions on the number of hours that these units are permitted to run?
Thanks very much.
Best,
