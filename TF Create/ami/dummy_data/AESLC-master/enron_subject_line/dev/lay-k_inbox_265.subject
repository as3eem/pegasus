Mr. Lay,  I wanted to send you a short note and let you know that I am behind you, and I am remaining focused on the job ahead.
I also wanted to thank you for your candidness in answering questions and providing information during the All-Employee Meeting on Tuesday.
As you and the management team work through the issues, that we as a company face, I will be praying for you and the team that God will give you the strength to stand firm on the integrity that has made this company what it is today.
"The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity."
Proverbs 11:3  Sincerely,
