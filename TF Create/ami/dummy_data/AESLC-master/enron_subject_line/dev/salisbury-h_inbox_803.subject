Although we hate to lose her, Holli has resigned from her position with Enron in Portland to pursue other career interests.
She will be coming in later this week or next to say her goodbyes, but other than that she will not be in.
Please refer any business or phone calls that you would have referred to Holli to me, or, in my absence, to John Malowney or Stewart Rosman.
Thanks
