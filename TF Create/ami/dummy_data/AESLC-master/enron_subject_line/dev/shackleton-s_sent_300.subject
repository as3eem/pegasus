I understand that you spoke with Mark Taylor about eliminating references to  individuals in confirms.
I need to speak with you about the ISDA, omnibus  and industrial master templates under revision and whether the drafted  language conforms to your proposal.
In that regard, you may recall that swap  templates were given to you several months ago.
The legal group is  concluding a massive form review which necessitates confirm changes.
Thanks.
