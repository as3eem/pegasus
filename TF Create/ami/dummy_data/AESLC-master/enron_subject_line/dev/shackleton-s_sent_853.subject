I spoke briefly with Gary Perlmutter who now represents the parent Sempra  Energy but who told me that restrictions on the regulated utility have been  lifted by the CA PUC.
I will verify (or I'll give you his name, etc.
and you  can speak with him directly) when the SDG&E lawyer returns my call.
Thus I  am not sure that your online efforts require limitation.
I will also inquire  about SDG&E's online objectives.
