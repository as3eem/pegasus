The subject line of this email is hardly news.
How have companies toughed out past downturns and gone on to succeed?
What did it take in terms of leadership, strategy and execution for companies to continue growing and prosper in past downturns?
What were the key differentiators in sales and marketing, human resource and financing success?
As you know from the last email I sent you, the VentureWire Executive Summit on November 6 in San Jose plans to get the answers to these and many other questions.
We?ve called together a superb roster of speakers and panelists who have built companies in difficult times, and positioned them well to ride past upturns.
How will organizations need to be structured to be ready for when the current market rebounds?
Where is the money to be had until that rebound happens?
Our roster of speakers are supremely well-qualified to answer these and other pressing questions.
