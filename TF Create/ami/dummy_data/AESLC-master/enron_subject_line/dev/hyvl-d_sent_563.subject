Stacey Neuweiler asked that I forward this to you so that you could print 2  copies of each document and give them to her boss for signature.
I have  reviewed the form of the agreements with Mitch Dutton and agreed that they  are these transporter's typical form.
If time would permit, I suggested they  negotiate the penalty language, otherwise the forms are okay.
Call me at  713-853-6895 if you have any questions.
I am also forwarding the Duke  documents for you to print off and have signed.
