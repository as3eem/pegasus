September 13, 2001  Dear JEFFREY SKILLING:  We are writing to you (and the thousands of other Texas households who have chosen NewPower as their new Retail Electric Provider) to keep you informed on the latest developments in the Texas Electric Choice Pilot program.
There have been delays in implementing the Texas Electric Choice Pilot program, but none of these delays are going to ultimately prevent NewPower from using our energy expertise to deliver savings on electricity to our customers.
Nor will they prevent your local utility from providing the same reliable service.
Here is the latest information from the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT):  1.
After several delays, we are pleased to announce the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) began processing switch requests to NewPower on July 31, 2001.
2.
Unfortunately, the switch requests are being processed by ERCOT at a much slower pace than originally promised.
3.
As a result, based on past experience, NewPower has been given estimates that your actual switch date could take place anytime between now and November 2001.
NewPower must comply with the revised ERCOT timetable.
We can't supply you with electricity until ERCOT processes the switch request.
But here's what we can do:  1.
First and foremost, we want to assure you that we are committed to providing the stability and value you were promised when you signed up with NewPower for electricity supply... despite these delays.
2.
As soon as your switch request is processed by ERCOT, we'll send you a welcome letter notifying you that your service has been switched to NewPower 3.
In the meantime, we are doing everything we can to encourage ERCOT to process your switch request more quickly so that you can receive the savings you expect from NewPower as soon as possible.
