Happy Birthday old man.
I am not sure if my voice mail will make it to you(I  got some weird instructions), so I thought I would cover my bases.
I have  been real busy at work and did not mail your gift until Friday.
It will be a  few days late - sorry.
Hope you enjoyed your bachelor time this weekend.
Can't beat peace and quiet.
Talk to you soon.
