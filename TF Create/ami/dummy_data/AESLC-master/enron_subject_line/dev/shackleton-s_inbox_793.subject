WRT the contract that has "cost of funds" (CoF) plus x for the default interest rate, I am struggling to get a number.
Someone in Deffner's group said he didn't know our CoF but that it will be a ridiculously high number.
I spoke to someone in Corp and he suggested that the contract might address an interest rate in the event of bankruptcy.
What do you think?
