Hello All,             We have sucessfullly sorted some network issues in portland and the curve manager is ready to run on the  local machine now.
The terminal server can be used as a backup in case the curve manager fails on the local machine.
I like to thank everyone for their efforts in getting this problem resolved.
Regards   - Arun
