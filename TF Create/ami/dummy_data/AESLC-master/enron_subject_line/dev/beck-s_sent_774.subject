Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.
I can  view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12  attendees.
There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.
I am  missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?
If I am not  missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees  (all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).
A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees  looks funny.
There were many more in attendance.
The cost of the meal makes  more sense with a complete list of attendees.
Thanks.
