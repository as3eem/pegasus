Karen and I will handle stuff for pizza friday night, and most of dinner Saturday (thinking scallops and ???).
Will scallops work, Prentice?
If not, have a suggested alternate or something to add that you'd like?
Jeff can you bring breakfast stuff for both mornings and salad stuff for friday and saturday eve.
We figure we can pick up saturday lunch items on saturday....
Cool???
