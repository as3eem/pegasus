Welcome back all of you veteran pickers!
I?d like to introduce our three new rookies:  The Deitrick?s - Val and Scott - from napa Andy Bledsoe - from Napa Kent Deverell - from San Francisco  Good luck to all!!
Steve McCarthy is not in the pool this year (we'll miss his bazaar picks) and we aren't sure if Carlton is still in.
If he is, we'll have a total of 27; if not it'll be 26.
We'll send out a completed report of the projected payouts before the first week of the season starts.
Attached are two Excel files.
The first one just has the pick sheet for week #1   One easy way to submit the weekly picks is to: 1)	Click on this sheet and open it in Excel 2)	Fill in the information at the top 3)	Make your weekly picks by putting numbers in the cell with the line under it by the team you want to pick.
(This will also give you a check figure at the bottom to be sure you have gotten, at least,  the correct total - not necessarily the WINNING numbers, however!)
4)	Save and close the file 5)	Use "FORWARD" to get the e-mail back to me at eldon@direcpc.com 6)	If you use "REPLY" the attachment does not get sent  It really makes a huge difference in the amount of time it takes to do the statistical work if you use this form so we really appreciate getting your picks this way.
