I'm scheduled to meet with Kari at 3:30 PST tomorrow, ostensibly to talk  about demand buy-down.
Also presume to message the letter from Steve Kean to  the Senators and our solution (perhaps in advance of meetings, phone calls  that might take place later in the week with legislative leaders).
But would  like to add to agenda for discussion on tomorrow's daily call in the event  folks have additional suggestions.
Best,
