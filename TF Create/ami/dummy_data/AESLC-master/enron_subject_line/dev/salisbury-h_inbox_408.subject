Please keep in mind when entering NPC transmission into Enpower.
Beginning July 2001, the ancillary services rate for Nevada Power has been changed from $0.70 to $0.58539(roughly 59 cents) per MWh.
TOTAL = $0.58539 per MWh  Reserved transmission is $1.70 LLoad  $2.90 HVLoad  If the transmission is wheeled the .59 should be added to the reserved price and the amount entered should be:  $2.29  LLoad  $3.49  HVload  The problems I see are deals entered at prices of $4.10, $3.60, or $2.40 or deals have been entered in at the reservation charge even though they the transmission was used.
Thanks
