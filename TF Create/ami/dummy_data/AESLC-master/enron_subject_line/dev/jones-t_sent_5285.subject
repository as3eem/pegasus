Below is an email Dovie sent out a while back referencing the procedures for  sending out NDA's.
When you need an NDA, please email me the following  information.
I then contact a paralegal that maintains a database of our  NDA's to check for conflicts.
Once we've done that I will prepare and send  out the NDA as directed by you, then work with you as appropriate in the  particular client situation to get the NDA back signed.
Once it is fully  executed I need to send the original to the same paralegal here who is the  central gatekeeper of all NDA's.
My number is x33399 if I can assist you with anything.
