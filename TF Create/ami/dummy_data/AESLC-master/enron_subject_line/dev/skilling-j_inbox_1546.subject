Dear Jeff,  You may recognize my name as a member of the Houston YPO chapter.
We met briefly at the April technology program, which by the way, was fascinating.
I   read in the Houston Business Journal of the San Francisco pie incident and thought your follow-through on the speech was perfect.
Look at the bright side, you're in great company!
I'm writing to solicit your advice on how my business can best capitalize on the ever-changing energy business.
As some background information, I'm responsible for a group of companies that are primarily in the businesses of manufacturing, personalizing and mailing laser printed billing statements and credit cards.
Personix is an industry leader in the markets we serve and Enron is a larger user of the types of services our company provides.
At the present time, we do not do business with Enron.
I've read where Enron has established an electricity retailing operation in anticipation of the Texas electricity market deregulation.
We would like to discuss with the appropriate person in your organization how our billing statement solutions may be of interest to Enron for your various energy and broadband businesses.
I would appreciate it if you could pass our name along in order to advance these discussions.
Thanks and look forward to seeing you at the next YPO event.
Regards,
