Buenos dias Energy Committee compadres,  Attento!
Just a reminder that our EC meeting will be held tomorrow at AMD in Sunnyvale at 3pm.
Dr. R. Sean Randolph, President of the Bay Area Economic Forum will be our guest speaker, and will detail the Economic Forum's new report on long-term reform of California's power markets.
An updated agenda is attached.
And as if that wasn't enough to get you interested...  Also attached is an invitation to participate in the CEC Electronics Industry Energy Advisory Group.
This will be discussed in depth, including a list of candidate projects that will be funded by the CEC, at the Energy Committee tomorrow.
This is an opportunity to secure funding for future energy projects.
Don't miss out!
