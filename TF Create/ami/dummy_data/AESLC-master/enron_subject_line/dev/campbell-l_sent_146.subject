I received a phone call from Frank Van Ryn of Koch, concerning the letter  that was sent to him on 6/19.
Frank has stated that Koch will be contacting  Arco concerning the two contamination issues.
Apparently Koch has been  indemnified by Arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue  at well.
In any event, Frank said that he would be getting back with me in a  couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup, but wanted to  discuss the issue with Arco.
I will keep everyone apprised on the progress.
