Dear Mr. Lay,  i have just returned home after picking up Victor at Shepherd/Kirby and bringing him to the grocery store.
He shared with me that you had stopped to say hi and gave him $20 from your wallet.
This email is to convey my warmest personal thanks to you for your generosity to those less fortunate.
i have paid for an apartment on Commonwealth for 3 years for him, and check on him every day...he has also volunteered his time and efforts to several of my former work projects - JDF, MS150, etc.
i will be going into redeployment next monday, and hopefully will be fortunate enough to stay on at ENRON.
If it doesn't work out, please know that I am grateful for the 4 years I spent there - the company has treated me very well, and i will always remain loyal and dedicated to you.
