Hello everyone, I am doing an inquiry as to what each families level of participation will be for thanksgivings.....
If it is a immediate family only event, when will you be arriving in Galveston, how many people in your family will be there and will you be attending the dinner?
Mr and Mrs Lay will be there from the 21-25th of November.
If it is a family plus dinner then what will be your level of participation then?
Please answer all the above questions as well as who else you would like to invite?
Please respond by October 5th.
Thanks barb
