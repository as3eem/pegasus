I hope everyone is safe.
What a crazy frightening day.
I spoke with Mom and Dad and they wanted me to let ya'll know that they are not sure if they will be flying back from Vegas tomorrow or not.
It all depends on what happens next.
They will e-mail you when they get back.
Love to you all.
P.S.
I still have 3 weeks to go.
