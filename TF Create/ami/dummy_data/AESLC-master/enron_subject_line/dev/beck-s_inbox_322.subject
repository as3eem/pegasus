Sally,  I was scanning the brochure for the referenced conference, and noticed that Operational Risk is being addressed by an Enron Corp. employee, Kevin Kindall.
I tried to locate him on our People finder, but could not locate him.
I was just curious if you know who he is?
The brochure lists him as a manager.
Although I can not attend due to the Impact & Influence conference, it is the type of conference I would love to attend in the future.
