I made a few changes from on the Socal forecast:  1.)
Put in the updated PV, NP, & SP power curves - now the generators are  running at peak levels 2.)
Increased Ehrenberg from 1.2 to 1.25 3.)
Took off the weather adjustments when the new SP generation begins  The new forecast brings Socal storage to a max of 86 Bcf before Q3.
We can  discuss this further on Monday.
