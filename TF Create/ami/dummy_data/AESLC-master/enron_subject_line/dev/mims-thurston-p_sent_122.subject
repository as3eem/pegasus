Bobbi,   Attached are the final numbers for the interruptible balancing for November,  2000.
I have also attached a tentative schedule for December, 2000 for both  the firm and interruptible.
Those schedules will probably be revised once we  get through December 1st nominations and "boo-boos".
Thanks
