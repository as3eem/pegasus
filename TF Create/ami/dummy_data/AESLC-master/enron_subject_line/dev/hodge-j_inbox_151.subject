Dear Subscriber:   In our continuous commitment to enhance the services we offer you, Factiva is proud to announce the expanded availability of the Financial Times (FT).
Commencing June 16, the full text from all editions of the FT, including FT.com, will be accessible to all Publications Library and CustomClips customers.
The FT will continue to be unavailable in Business Newsstand.
The rollout of the full text of the FT complements Factiva's compelling content set of top must-read global business sources including The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones, Reuters and AP Newswires.
In addition, this unique source combination will be offered at launch in Factiva.com, our new flagship product.
The full text will replace the FT Abstracts.
In order to provide you with uninterrupted coverage, the full text of all articles from June 1 on will be made available.
The FT abstract archive to date will continue to be accessible to you as well.
This change will require no action on your part.
The full text of the FT will have the same source codes that were previously applied to the FT Abstracts.
This means your CustomClips folders and saved searches will automatically get this expanded content - and it will be available on day of publication to provide you with the most up-to-date global business information.
If you have any questions, please contact your account executive.
Regards,
