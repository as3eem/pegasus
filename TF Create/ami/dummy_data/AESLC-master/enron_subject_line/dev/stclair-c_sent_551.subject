Russell: I spoke with the contact that you left me last week and she indicated that  the ISDA had not yet been signed but that in all likelihood it would be  signed in a few days.
I asked Susan bailey to send you the certificate with  resolutions that you requested along with a new draft of the Transfer  Agreement which has a blank for the date.
My thought was that everything  would become effective on the date that we insert in the Transfer Agreement  and I would ask that you coordinate with Susan bailey when you know what that  date will be so that we can make sure that our systems reflect when the  trades are to be confirmed under the Utilicorp Master.
Thanks.
