Hi all,  We have updated the PSIM model.
The current version can handle more realistic operational constraints by selecting "Semi Optimal Dispatch" toggle for Dispatch  Mode.
This dispatch mode considers minimum up hours, minimum down hours, ramp-up hours, start up cost, fuel switching cost, forward looking within a  user-specified period of time.
It also allows user to enter their estimate of ISO  curtailment on their generation capacity by month in "Asset" page.
You need to put Frontera.dll in your C:\Winnet directory, and the spreadsheet and help files in one directory of your choice.
Alex
