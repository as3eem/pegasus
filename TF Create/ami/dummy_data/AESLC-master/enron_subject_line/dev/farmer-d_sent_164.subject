You may want to come to this meeting.
When we met with Bob Hall the other  dayon OA, I mentioned that you and I should probably be included in the  monthly meeting so that we would have an idea of any problems that were  occurring each month.
If you have something else going on, don't worry about  being there.
I'll relay the info to you.
