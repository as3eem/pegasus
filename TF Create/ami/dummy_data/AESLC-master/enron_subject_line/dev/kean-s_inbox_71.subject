Hi, Steve -             I've been thinking of you quite a bit over the past few months as the       Enron woes have unfolded and finally decided to drop you a line.
I       hope you're keeping your legendary sense of perspective.
One of the       things I have admired about you is that you never lose sight of the       fact that people make an organization successful, a lesson many of       your Enron peers apparently have yet to learn.
Maybe it comes from       having priorities other than making money ot being powerful, but my       conversations with friends demonstrates that they still appreciate       your loyalty to your staff.
Philadelphia agrees very well with Michael and me.
We're getting       ensconced in our house and adjusting to life in the 'burbs.
Fortunately, we're in Bryn Mawr, where we have a college town, rather       than suburban, environment.
In fact, we are within three miles of       four four-year colleges!
I've seen Mike Terrasso at some of the EHS       meetings - what a thoughtful, gentle man.
Although I miss some of the excitement and intellectual stimulation of       working at Enron, I don't miss Houston (except for the people).
However, I'm energized by the notion of incorporating EHS excellence       into a coherent management system that focuses on improving the bottom       line, and I'm enjoying the challenge of managing a large staff again.
Given all of the recent consolidation in the refining industry, I'm       thankful for Sunoco's strong perfromance over the past couple of years       and hope that we can remain independent for a few more years.
Do let me know if you get to the East Coast.
We'd love to take you to       dinner.
Take care, and hang in there!
