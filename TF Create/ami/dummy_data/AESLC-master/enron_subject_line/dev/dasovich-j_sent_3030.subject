I've still got considerable work to do, but wanted to make sure all had a  chance to review and comment well in advance of finalizing.
I'm giving a  talk at Exnet on Monday about California.
Attached is a draft of the  slides.
All comments welcome and appreciated.
I'm continuing to work on  it.
Thanks very much.
Best,
