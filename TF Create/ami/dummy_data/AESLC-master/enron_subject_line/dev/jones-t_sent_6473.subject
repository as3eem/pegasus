Per our earlier discussions, I am attaching the language we would like added  to the definition of Index in the long descriptions for all US physical and  financial pulp, paper and lumber products.
If you have any questions, please  give Mark or me a call.
Justin, as an FYI, is this something you might want to add to your European  products as well?
