Per my discussions with Leslie Hansen and Dave Forster, please restrict  Australian based counterparties from trading US physical power on a going  forward basis.
To the best of our knowledge, no Australian based  counterparty has been granted a FERC license to trade physical US power.
This situation, of course, can change if a counterparty were to provide us  evidence of their FERC licensing.
