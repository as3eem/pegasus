Based on information received at 4 pm this afternoon from Comm.
Brown, the CPUC is reportedly set to suspend direct access tomorrow with an effective date of Sept. 20 for the suspension.
There has been a huge drop in state tax revenues this week as a result of economic inactivity due to the terrotist attacks, and this appears to have reinvigorated the need to issue bonds--if they can be sold.
In any event, it appears Brown is a solid vote
