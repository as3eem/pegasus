Dave,  Attached is a rough draft of the letter we discussed.
The right to  match option is a little less drastic than the "saving sharing" we  discussed.
The savings sharing is a little more problematic to enforce.
We  can discuss though, if that is really the way you want to go.
Please review  and lets discuss.
