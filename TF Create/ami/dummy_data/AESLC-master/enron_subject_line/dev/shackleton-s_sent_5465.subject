Melissa:  Please refer to Janelle's request for a draft confirm.
The  counterparty's  draft has a floating price reference and you should verify with Janelle.
Use  the ISDA format; the counterparty is the "Power Authority for the State of  New York".
Ignore the "junk" in the counterparty's form.
I have no other  info about the particular deal.
Call if you have any questions and please  send me a copy.
