As some of you may be aware, there have been substantial revisions to the  U.S. Tax Code which will require revising the tax language in our swap  agreements.
I will be providing Steve Douglas in the Tax Dept.
copies of the  current tax language in our swap agreements and will coordinate with him  revisions to the forms.
I'll keep you posted when the changes occur.
