I'm still here at the office...the customer's have my car blocked in...sooooo...I guess I will stay awhile longer.
did I tell you that the workers have finished installing our toilet flushing system??
We have 6 toilets and they have been set up where they can be flushed with water from our rainwater cistern (it holds like 30,000 gallons).
cool huh, water is so expensive here and rain is free!
Armin is talking with the customers about doing it, but they are thinking they want to wash their clothes with it too...i don't think that's such a good idea, the water is not purified...but the washingmachine does heat itself, it doesn't use a hot water heater...so I "guess" it could be ok...
Anyway...I'M BORED!!!
you could write me!!!
