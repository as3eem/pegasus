Just to alert you.
The new CPUC proposed decision to suspend DA to be voted on next week has some language of concern and I wanted you to be aware of it  This new language, which was circulated today, implies some retroactive action by the CPUC -- but not on the suspension issue.
So, some financial risk is possible.
The language follows.
We will endeavor to get the language removed (long-shot) or clarified (also long-shot).
