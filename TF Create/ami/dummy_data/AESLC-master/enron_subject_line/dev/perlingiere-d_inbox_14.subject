Hello Debra:  As you know, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.
("DETM") and Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") are operating under a GISB Base Contract dated December 1, 2000, which covers all of our companies' spot transactions.
However, we still need a contract to cover our companies' term transactions.
Accordingly, DETM has reviewed ENA's standard master agreement and has some proposed revisions to this document; attached is a redlined agreement which reflects DETM's requested changes.
Please review DETM's changes to ENA's agreement and let me know if they are acceptable.
We would like to execute this agreement as soon as possible since we currently do not have an agreement that covers our term transactions, so your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated.
Thank you for your assistance.
