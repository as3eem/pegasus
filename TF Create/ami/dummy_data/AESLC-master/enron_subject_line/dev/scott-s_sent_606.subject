So I met him for dinner Thursday night.
Nothing was discussed until we were  about to leave and I couldn't hold my tongue any longer.
Turns out he was  married before and may have some issues (pretty big ones in my opinion - case  in point, he's been divorced three years and, by his own admission, has dated  quite a bit in the interim but nothing that has lasted longer than 2 mos.
-  sounds like a pattern to me).
We'll talk more later, sscott5
