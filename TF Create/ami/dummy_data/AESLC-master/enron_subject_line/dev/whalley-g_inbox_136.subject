The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.
The following is a summary of the meeting.
The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).
RTOs   Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.
Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.
