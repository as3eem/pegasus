Hi Jeff!
I didn't know where else to direct my question, so you are the lucky one!
Periodically, I receive books/updates from West Publishing (Westlaw people) for our law library.
Previously, I was giving these to Keegan.
With Keegan and Barbara no longer here, I am not sure what to do about these books and updates.
Help!
Signed, Glad to Still Be Here
