We expect to have a change order executed by ABB on Monday (Tuesday at the  latest) whereby we agree to pay all but the retainage amount, and they  acknowledge that we can assign it to WHOEVER, including the agent (right?).
Ben and I discussed the fact that the Coral turbines will be moved into  TurboPark.
I believe we will want to assign the turbines to an Enron LLC the  following week.
FYI, we have a conference call tomorrow to finish the binding  agreement to see them the turbines.
If it would work to keep them in WestLB,  that's great.
However, I want to do whatever creates the least amount of  stress for you two.
I'll manage Coral and Ben.
Please advise.
Ciao,  Kay  PS.
Just in case you don't know, your efforts are very appreciated.
Not  just by me!
