You know, I must have received your message on Tuesday because I remember  reading it - but I can't find it in my computer.
Can you resend so I'll have  the dates?
My guess is you shouldn't arrange space for me.
If I can get  there for part of the time and there is a spare couch then fine & if not I'm  sure I'll find a room somewhere close by.
