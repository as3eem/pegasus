David: CP&L has marked up a confirm that we sent to them for a deal that was done  5/8/2001 to make it subject to their 5/18/98 Tariff agreement.
We are in the  process of negotiating an EEI Master with them but have some outstanding  credit issues.
How should I respond to their mark-up?
This was one of  Janice's files.
