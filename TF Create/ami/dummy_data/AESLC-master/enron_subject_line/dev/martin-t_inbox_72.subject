I talked to Lisa this morning.
She said it does not matter to them if we use the travel agent or just do it ourselves.
She does not mind calling the travel agent if we want to do that.
She is real busy right now trying to get W-2's and 1099's out before the end of the month on top of other things.
She has been working late alot.
I guess we could check to see what we can find and then let them know.
