Alright ladies, Thursday night is in Week 4 so it's looking like June 21 for the beginning of the next league.
I put us on the list ("We're getting the band back together man").
Currently on the roster:  Hatch Dan Willie Ferg Kriendler Todd  We're looking for some players:  Shea (Jessy, could you forward this for me) Esones Wayne Kirby (Ferg, get with Kirbster, Glen and Lawrence) Glen Lawrence  Davison is holding out at training camp until we raise his signing bonus.
We play double headers at 290/Jones.
Let me know if you're interested.
