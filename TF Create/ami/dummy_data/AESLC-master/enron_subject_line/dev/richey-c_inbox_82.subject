Cooper-- I have been looking at the chassis for the  model we need to develop.
it looks like we can expand (piggy back) the model AE  uses for the Snow & water supply forecasts.
They only have reports for March  thru to August i.e.
the period of the bulk of the runoff from snow and rain.
We  would have to add the remainder of the year as well as the power plants.
Will  fax ou a sketch of my proposed basic layout.
