Dear Colleagues,  We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks.
Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available.
Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.
I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.
We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.
David Oxley Head, Human Resources
