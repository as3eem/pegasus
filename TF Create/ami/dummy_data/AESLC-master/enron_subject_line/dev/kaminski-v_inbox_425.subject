Vince,     IT had informed me that you were interested in our liquidity margin model over the weekend.
Here attached is a brief synopsis of the workings of the model, including methodology, a validation example, and web-page front ends.
It has been in use daily for the past month and a half, after going through a prototyping and implementational phase.
Please let me know if you have any questions,  Naveen
