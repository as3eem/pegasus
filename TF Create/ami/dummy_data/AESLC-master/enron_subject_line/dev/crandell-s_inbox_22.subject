Dear Amy,    My apologies that it has taken me a day or two to respond about the December 2001 checkout.
I have spoken with our traders and learned that the reason EPMI deals # 585276.1 and 585277.1 are not in the system beyond December 2, 2001 is because (due to bankruptcy proceedings), Modesto Irrigation District requested termination of our contract on December 2, 2001.
I understand that there was physical delivery every day of the month and I am working with our teams to get this in our system correctly.
Please call me if you have any questions.
I will send you an email when this has been finished.
Thanks,     Virginia
