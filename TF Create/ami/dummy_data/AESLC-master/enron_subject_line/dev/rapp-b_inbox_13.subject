Pam, would you do a request to have Bill Rapp's extensions (853-5269) to ring on my phone (853-7172) and on Maxine Smith's  (853-5325).
I would also like a Send Calls button for him if that's still available since our locations are across the floor.
Please charge it to Company 0366 and Cost Center 111679.
In case you also need our locations......  Emily's EB4771 Maxine's EB4769  Let me know if you need any more info.....Thanks for all your help
