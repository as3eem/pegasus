Chris:  Further to your call on Friday, the Letter Agreement does not require NorSub to consent to the invoices that GE submits for the installments of Purchase Amount due and payable by ENA.
Instead, Section 8(a) of the Letter Agreement requires ENA to "provide NorSub with notice of each Remaining Purchase Amount Installment which is paid by ENA (including the date and the amount thereof) prompltly after payment thereof by ENA."
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.
Regards,
