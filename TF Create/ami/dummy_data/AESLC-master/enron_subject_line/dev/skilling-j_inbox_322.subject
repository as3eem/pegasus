Jeff,   Nice work.
In my opinion you did a much better job than any of  the others interviewed for the program, including the VP.
That last portion with the CEO of Duke and Gray Davis reminded  me of a lot of those "60 Minutes" episodes back in the good old days when they  used to catch people with their hands waaay down in the cookie jar.
Good lord  those two looked terribly guilty of something.
Please remind my sister that she is supposed to give me a  heads up on things like this.
Hope all is well.
Steve
