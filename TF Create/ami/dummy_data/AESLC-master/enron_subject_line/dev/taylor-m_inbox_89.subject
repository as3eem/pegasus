Mark;  I saw your note replying to my earlier e-mail today re.
ISDA (thanks).
Alt= hough it is Enron Brazil's goal to be able to enter into these type of ener= gy commodities derivatives transactions in the future, it seems to me that = there are several tax implications (still to be resolved and/or optimized) = which prevent us from participating in this market.
Considering your and Brent's energy commodity derivatives experience in the=  US, do you think you could assist me to put together this "Wish List" for = ISDA to discuss with the Brazilian authorities ?
Tks,  Sami
