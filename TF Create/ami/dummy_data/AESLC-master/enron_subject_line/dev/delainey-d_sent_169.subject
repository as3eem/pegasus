Colleen, thanks for the update - as another part of the nat gas value chain,  traded transportation, with and without EOL should be a priority.
However, I  think we have to ensure that we have rules and procedures accepted by the  FERC that will allow the market to work.
Jim, can you ensure that Colleen and Julie have the regulatory support needed  to ensure that the market gets set up appropriately.
Thanks.
