Brent and Lynn:  I have a severe case of laryngitis and I can't even speak.
I'm not sure that I'll be able to (or even should) speak on Friday for our 9  am (Houston) conference.
Brent, I was wondering if you would be in Houston  next week before our legal conference on Thursday and Friday.
If so, then  maybe you, Lynn and I can meet to assess the situation.
If not, then let's  please reschedule our Friday call for Monday or Tuesday of next week.
I can  suggest Monday after 10 am.
Tuesday morning we have Randy's call which I may  have to begin taking at home due to the early hour so if we decide on  Tuesday, it should be after 10:30 am..
Please let me hear from you.
Thanks.
Sara
