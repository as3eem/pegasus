This is a copy of the presentation that Bob Superty made to the Peoples  Energy Board this week.
Lousie Kitchen told me that he was very impressive  in the presentation (not a surprise to me, but it is nice when others  recognize the talent that is in the operations organization).
We may be able  to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal  purposes, and there may be parts of this that could be used in external  marketing tools.
