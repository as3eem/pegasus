Pete,  Just a quick note to see how things are going down there?
I'm sorry to hear that Enron's on some tough times, hope you're area is safe.
Got to love paying Andersen for their quality financial statements huh?
Old AA is in hot water for their F/S for Enron, Waste Management Inc. and couple other companies.
Their getting some pretty bad press and rightfully deserved, since all they've tried to focus on is building up a consulting firm years before the inevitable split with Andersen Consulting (Accenture).
On a personal side, hope you, Anne and the girls are doing ok.  Kim and I move into our new place on Monday.
Of course we were supposed to move in back in September, but what can you do.
We're cutting it close to Kim's due date, but if she keep her legs together until after Monday we should be ok.
