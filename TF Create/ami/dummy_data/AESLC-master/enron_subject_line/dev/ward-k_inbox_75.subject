OK, just talked to LP  We are going to meet up later with his Aunt & Uncle (very fun people) and he and Cher around 9pm.
I have to go to a happy hour for Tosha's departure at 5:30 at Tealas.
You are welcome to come if you like.
Also, we have been invited to go down to the bay near Galveston and ride Jetskis tomorrow afternoon with LP and Cher.
A guy from Halliburton has a big spread down there and it sounds like fun.
We are planning to go around lunch time.
That is good bc I need to get some stuff done tomorrow around the house.
Are you in??
I hope so.
