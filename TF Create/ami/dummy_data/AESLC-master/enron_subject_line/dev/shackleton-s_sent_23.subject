Attached is our form of confirm with attached Annex A (general terms and  conditions).
Assume the confirm is governed by Texas law.
Most  counterparties sign the confirm and fax it back to us WITHOUT the attached  Annex A.
Is this sufficient under Texas law as having received the  "executed" confirmation?
Do we need to modify our language incorporating the  Annex A?
Thanks.
