Another Division  Mark,  Global Counterparty wants me to approve this EOL counterparty which is a  division.
My deal with the EOL team was that they would kick these  counterparties back and try to get the legal incorporated entity as part of  the name.
Global Counterparty is satisfied opening counterparties up as  divisions and I am getting frustrated constantly fighting this battle.
Do  you wish to intercede, or shall I give up and let counterparties be opened as  divisions?
Do you want to call a meeting with Sam's boss to discuss  divisions?
What to do?
