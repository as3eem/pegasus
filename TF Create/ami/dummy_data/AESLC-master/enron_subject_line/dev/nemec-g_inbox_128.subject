Gerald,  Attached is a copy of the draft Reciprocal Keep Whole language for the MMS deal.
Also, one other Global change to the Reciprocal Keep Whole language that I have not made is that the publication for Gas Daily apparently has changed from Financial Times to Platts?
I was not sure what the exact name we are supposed to use for the publication.
