Hi Folks,  Another wild week in the NFL.
We've got Footballguy Scott Luebke's Week 7 Upgrade - Downgrade - Waiver Wire Picks.
Before we get to that though, let me throw out something I posted today on our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing themselves.
This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear.
From our Message Boards www.footballguystalk.com  One of our message board members was (justifiably) frustrated with watching Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams fared less well as his starters.
My reply to him:  Don't be down on yourself.
That's the nature of the game.
There is no way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was such a question mark last week.
You did what just about every one of us would have done I'm guessing.
It's part of the game.
Is it frustrating?
Sure it is.
But it's still part of the game.
In my local league last week, I took a chance again on Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks (but not week 5 - Aargh... )   Did it play out?
No, it didn't.
I had guys on my bench who outscored him.
But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and Billy Schroeder, it was the right call for me.
I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football.
You just have to take the best info you can assemble, make your call and let the players do the rest.
Just like a real GM.
You can only do so much.
If you got beat because you didn't know Terry Glenn was out and you started him, well, that's your bad.
But if you got beat because Trung Canidate decided to play the game of his life, and proven RBs Williams and Green did not, well, that's not your fault.
I promise you, if you can predict things to that degree, you need to quit your job and head to Vegas.
Control what you can control.
Bust your butt to know all you can know.
Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable you've done all you can do.
After that, just enjoy the games.
Trust me, you'll be a better owner because of it.
Ok, let's jump to Scott's report for this week.
Have a great week, everyone.
Joe  /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Upgrades   QB - Tom Brady (Waiver Wire) - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks deserves an upgrade in my book.
More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an interception this season.
When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots' coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make.
There's even some talk that Bledsoe might not return this season.
Right now, Brady deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback.
QB - Tim Couch - The yardage numbers won't win any awards, but the 4 touchdowns in the last 2 games is impressive.
Couch is starting to show signs of becoming a very good quarterback in this league.
Keep in mind, a tough schedule looms ahead for Couch.
However, with the Browns offense improving, he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper league looking towards the future.
QB - Doug Flutie - The Flutie magic continues to strike.
He's not the best fantasy quarterback, but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by inserting Flutie into the lineup.
With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying healthy, Flutie should be considered a top 15 quarterback this season.
With a strong rushing game keeping defenses honest, look for Flutie to post numbers similar to Sunday on occasion.
280 passing yards and 2 scores is respectable against a tough Denver defense.
RB - Anthony Thomas -The A-Train continues to ride into fantasy starting
