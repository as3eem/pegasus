I just got a call from Li Sun.
She is expecting to get her H-1 visa anytime, and wants to make sure that she receives it.
Should we have her contact Tindall & Foster directly?
Also, by law, when an individual on an H-1b visa is terminated, the company is required to provide them a one way ticket back to their home country.
Does that still apply in a bankruptcy?
If so, who will be handling those arrangements?
