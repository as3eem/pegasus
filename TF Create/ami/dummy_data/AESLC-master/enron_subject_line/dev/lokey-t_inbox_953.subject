The sessions scheduled with Stan for wednesday are to develop some base level assumptions for the purpose of creating a multi year plan (5-10) years into the future.
Be thinking about the critical assumptions that need to be considered in this undertaking.
I would like to leave the meeting with a base established.
If you need to bring someone else to the meeting, please let Kathy know for planning purposes.
