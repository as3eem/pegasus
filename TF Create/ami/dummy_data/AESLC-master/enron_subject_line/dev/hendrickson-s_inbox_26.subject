DTI have reached a 637 settlement with it's customers, they have filed with FERC for approval, the first pipeline to reach a settlement.
The settlement includes the netting and trading of imbalances, intraday recalls on released capacity, and other GISB mandates that took years to implement but in reality have no application to the industry.
Liquidity has increased on the system, TTT volumes have increased from 3 Bcf/d to 5 Bcf/d over the last year with a 5:1 ration of physical to traded volumes.
The interconnect with Empire @ Lysander currently flowing 30-60,000dt/d has a maximum capability of 100,000dt/d.
Empire is now allowing secondary deliveries to Lysander therefore volumes have increased at the location.
Note:  Empire recently bought out by Union from ANR.
DTI have an new pipeline project called Green brier.
A new company will be started that will consist of DTI as part owners and operators and other equity interests.
The new pipeline will flow 600,000 dt/d from Cornwell (interconnect with Tennessee and DTI) and run down through VA, into Granville County, NC.
DTI are offering winter only (30cents) and summer only (13cents) service, the project is designed to compete with Transco's Momentum expansion into Zn4.
DTI have remarketed all the 55 Bcf of GSS that was turned back over the past year and also reconstructed for 90% of the 2.2 Bcf/d of transport.
Another project they are looking to release to the market is an expansion of deliveries to Leidy in conjunction with Marketlink.
DTI have a current transportation offering, Lebanon to Leidy capacity 29,100dt/d, for one year starting 11/1/01.
DTI are looking and will probably get max rates (approximately 30 cents).
DTI will be increasing the transportation fuel rates from 2.28% to 2.78% as per a TCRA settlement recently agreed to by it's customers.
The net effect of this will be a small reduction in the delivered quantity at the delivery locations and a small amount of stranded receipt point capacity on peak days.
This news has not been released to the market, I'm not sure when this will take effect.
