Amy,  As discussed in my phone message,  we cannot agree to purposed revisions  regarding Sections 11.3 and 13.9.
Also, concerning Section 3.2 we cannot  agree to Cover Standard.
We are fine with 13.5 New York choice of law and  the remainder of suggested revisions.
Please e-mail or give me a call at  your convenience regarding this matter.
