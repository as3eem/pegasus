Bill:  For yet another day we seem to be having problems including all the schedules in our EPE schedule sheet.
Tag 52159 was not included (25mw schedule to LADWP).
I think part of the problem is some counterparties are not including EPMIWE as a PSE.
Fortunately, the dispatchers had the schedule and informed me of the problem.
I then called LADWP and WESCO to checkout with them.
If this did not happen we wouldn't have known what the deal was.
If you have any questions, please give me a call.
Bert
