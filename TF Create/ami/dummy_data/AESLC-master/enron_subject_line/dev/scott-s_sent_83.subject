Donna Fulton is planning on attending the technical conference in the  Amoco/Burlington complaint proceeding on El Paso's allocation procedures.
She has asked that we let her know, if possible, what particular issues we  are interested in, as this will help her prepare for the conference.
Please  let me know if you have any comments in this regard.
One caveat:  the technical conference is for "interested parties" only, and  since TW is not an intervenor Donna is subject to being kicked out of the  conf.
if El Paso does not want TW represented there.
ENA will probably be  sending a representative so at the very least we can probably get some  intelligence from them.
