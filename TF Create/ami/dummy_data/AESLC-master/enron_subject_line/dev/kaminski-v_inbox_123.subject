Hi Vince - Its very sad to see what has happened.
I hope you are doing OK under the circumstances.
I wanted also to let you know that I'm transitioning to an advisory role at Opt4  since they are now in a more operational mode, rather than developmental.
I've joined Charles River Associates in the Palo Alto office.
What are your plans for the future?
I would like to extend an invitation to get to know us better, and perhaps to collaborate if our interests coincide.
When do you get back from vacation?
