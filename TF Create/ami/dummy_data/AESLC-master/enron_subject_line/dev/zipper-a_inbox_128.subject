Following up from this afternoon's meeting, attached is a Word document that describes the specific mechanics for the tax refund that all will be receiving this year (as well as a description of why it is being made - it's a consequence of the tax rate reduction).
Also attached is a pdf file that sets forth the tax rate reduction schedule for the next 7 years - for several taxes in addition to the Federal Income tax (such as the Estate tax and AMT).
You can call me at x30938 with any questions.
