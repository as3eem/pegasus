Thought you might be interested in these two changes.
Mary has actually been  out of the office since late February.
All of her global database  responsibilities were transferred in late 2000 to James Scribner and his  team, under Beth Apollo.
Mary's effectiveness on CommodityLogic had been  lessened over time, and beginning with her absence in February I have relied  on my business leads (Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens) for  their evaluation of the NomLogic, ConfirmLogic and InvoiceLogic modules.
