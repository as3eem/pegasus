Wade here are the wiring instructions for two payments, one to the CAISO and one to Calpine:  CAISO:  $206,000  This amount represents two days' A/S and GMC charges, plus enough money to bring replenish the "3-day buffer."
Calpine:  $1,980,800  This represents two days' worth of energy to serve our California load.
Our price was $40/MWh.
By purchasing this energy from Calpine instead of the CAISO, we saved $120/MWh ($60/MWh + $100/MWh underscheduling penalty).
This is a savings of approximately $6 million over the next two days.
