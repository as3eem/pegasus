With respect to your email below,  I am already working with Bob Bowen on  assigning the various Aquila trades.
On Amoco, I will need to get a list similar to the one Bob prepared for me  for Aquila, showing the exact trades being assigned, deal no., whether they  are physical or financial, trade date, start date , end date, etc.
If you  get with Bob he can show you what he prepared for me for Aquila.
Once I get  that I can prepare the assignment.
I will also need the name and phone  number for the Amoco person I should be sending this assignment to.
I don't  know who will have that, the Confirm Desk, Settlements, or EOL?
Once I get  all this I can prepare that assignment.
