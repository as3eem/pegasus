After interviewing the short list of candidates, the Managing Directors of ETS met today to narrow the list to the final two.
They are; 	Everett Plante 	Brad Holmes  Mark, you will be contacted by HR to schedule an interview with each of these individuals.
Stan Horton will also be asked to interview them.
A final decision can be made at the conclusion of those discussions.
Expediting this decision will assist me in taking on my new responsibilities.
If there is any information I can provide you on the responsibilities of the current EGS position or on either of the candidates please let me know.
Thank you.
