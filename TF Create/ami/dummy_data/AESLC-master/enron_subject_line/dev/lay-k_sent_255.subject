I am disappointed that Joe Grundfest will not be able to join us at our next  Advisory Council meeting.
However Tom Campbell sounds like an excellent  alternative.
Would you please contact him and see if he might be willing to  join us for the next meeting and talk about the subjects you suggested.
Incidentally, we're happy to pay an honorarium to any of our guest speakers.
I think I should pass at this time on inviting Spence Abraham to join us for  dinner.
First, I believe it would be virtually impossible for him to do that  at this point in time.
But second, many people are already blaming me for  being the real energy policy maker in the new Administration and I would just  as soon not feed that speculation.
Look forward to seeing you.
Warm regards,
