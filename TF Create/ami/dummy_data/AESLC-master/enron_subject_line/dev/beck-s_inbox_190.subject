Sally - per our discussion, I have removed the following names from the NETCO organization chart which was submitted to Louise today.
Bob - we need to communicate to these individuals that they are still on the NETCO list but will be transferred at a later date, which is still to be determined.
I have relayed this information to Faith Killeen and her team who is trying to reconcile our budget with the NETCO list.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thanks, Leslie  Michelle Bruce Kris Hanson Dale Neuner Donnie Vinson Laura Dewitt Donnie Myers
