This E-Mail is directed toward current users of the RisktRAC application.
The purpose of this E-Mail is to notify users of pending review and removal of portfolios which are no longer being used.
Please review the list below and notify me or Burton Mcintyre if you have any objection to removing these portfolios.
Please note that removal of these portfolios will not delete their underlying sub-portfolios if those sub-portfolios exist under another hierarchy.
Please respond by Friday, May 25, if you feel any of these portfolios should be retained.
Thanks,
