Hello First Grade Brownies and  Parents,      Our November troop meeting will be November 6th at  St. Luke's Blanton Building.
The meeting starts at 3:30 and ends at  5pm.
Parents who signed up to help at the meeting are Melanie Morgan and  MK Cooper.
Just a few reminders: 1.
Remember to bring your assigned item for  our Troop First Aid Box.
2.
If you've been called to turn in lingering  paperwork, please bring it to the meeting.
3.
We try to end our meeting with a song or a  closing ceremony.
Please limit discussions in the area and siblings  running around as the girls are very easily distracted.
We are going to be decorating T-shirts at the  meeting.
(Moms who are helping, please wear old  clothes!)
Also we will be showing the girls the different  events they will be eligible to enter at STRIDERS.
STRIDERS is a Girl  Scout track and field day.
This year's event will be held on December 1st  from noon to about 5pm.
Paperwork will be coming home with the girls and  will need to be returned very quickly.
Please watch for it!
See everyone on the 6th!
Mrs. Lee, for all the leaders
