Sorry about the serial emails.
I need electronic versions of the final acknowledgement letters for both ABB  and GE, so that these can be emailed to them.
Please prepare a closing list.
Between this and the financing side, I'm  chasing quite a few documents.
I hope to have the escrow agreement signed today, but I would really like to  know we have the amendment finished.
Thanks,
