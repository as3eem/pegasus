RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  The NYISO has successfully migrated its billing system to a new server.
Re-billings for July 1st - 16th, 2001 were rerun and posted over the weekend.
In addition to the July 2001 re-billings, the NYISO also ran and posted the advisory billing statements for the July 2000 settlement adjustment.
Invoices for the July 2000 settlement adjustment and July 2001 initial billing are scheduled to be issued on August 7, 2001.
Customers are advised to resume their reviews of advisory billing statements and report anomalies to their Customer Relations Representatives.
The NYISO would like to thank our customers for their patience through this upgrade.
