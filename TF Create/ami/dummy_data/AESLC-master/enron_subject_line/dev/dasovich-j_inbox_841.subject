Haas Community,  This evening at about 5:00 p.m. we received a report that several piles of  white powder were placed throughout the Student Services Building and on  Gayley Plaza.
We barricaded as much of it as we could and the UCPD and the  Fire Department responded to our call.
We quickly discovered that the  white powder was plain flour that had been placed in Haas and across campus  by a student Ping Pong club on a cross campus footrace.
The student group is in the processing of cleaning up all of the piles of  white powder.
If you find any piles in the building that were missed,  please let us know so that we can get it all cleaned up right away.
