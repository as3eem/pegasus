At Friday's NYISO Management Committee meeting, two proposals were approved=  that will affect next year's rate schedule 1 charges.
The first involves t= he assessment of regulatory fees charged by FERC for its electric industry = costs.
As you are aware, effective next year, FERC will be changing the way=  its electric program costs are assessed to market participants.
Under the = new method, a unit charge will be assessed against public utilities providi= ng transmission service, including ISOs.
NYISO estimates an annual assessme= nt of $4-6 million.
These fees will start to be recovered through the rate = Schedule 1 charge effective January 1, 2002.
This should equate to roughly = $0.03 per MWH.
The second item approved at Friday's meeting concerned the p= roposed 2002 budget for the NYISO.
Total costs will be increasing roughly $= 12 million, which will raise the schedule 1 charges for running the ISO (cu= rrently $0.60 per MWH) by $0.03 to $0.05 per MWH, depending on the size of = the proposed contingency fund that may be included by the Board.
Offsetting=  these increases is the elimination of a $0.30 per MWH charge that has been=  collected during most of 2001 to create a $50 miilion working capital fund= .
The ISO expects to achieve full funding of this fund by the end of the cu= rrent year.
