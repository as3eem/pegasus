With Rod Hayslett's help, I put together an easy excel spreadsheet we can use to quickly evaluate capital investment projects.
It is set up for pipelines but can be modified for power development too.
If you add the inputs in the "yellow" boxes, the model can calcluate the rate you need to make the project viable.
You can change the debt/equity ratios, targeted ROE, and whether the project is new greenfield development or expansion of existing assets.
Let me know if you have questions.

I also put a copy in the Asset Development file folder.
