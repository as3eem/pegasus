Dear Ken,  I wrote you some time back about the campaign to raise ca.
$4 million to replace the American Heart Association's Houston regional headquarters building which burned this past April.
You were so kind in putting us in touch with Cindy Olson and Misha Siegel to discuss Enron's corporate position and the potential for assistance from the Ken and Linda Lay Foundation.
We deeply appreciated our meeting with Cindy and Misha.
Things have been progressing I'm pleased to say.
AHA has concluded a deal to sell the restored old building for approximately $1.15 million, and we have received substantial commitments from a very few individuals and Houston area foundations totaling approximately $600,000.
Therefore, our remaining challenge is to raise around $2-$2.25 million to complete the funding of a new building that will meet the needs of AHA in the years to come.
We have not yet been able to identify a very visible corporate or professional lead for the effort.
We will be discussing this possibility with Ernie Cockrell on November 6th.
As part of that conversation we would like to indicate notable leaders in Houston who would be willing to have their names affiliated with the capital campaign, perhaps as an Executive Committee or Advisory Committee.
The question to you is:  Would you approve the use of your name in your capacity at Enron and/or the name of the Ken and Linda Lay Foundation in this way?
Again, the AHA and I have been so deeply appreciative of your willingness to support the American Heart Association for so many years.
I hope we can call on you for this additional assistance at a time of need.
Thanks, Ken, for your consideration.
Best regards,
