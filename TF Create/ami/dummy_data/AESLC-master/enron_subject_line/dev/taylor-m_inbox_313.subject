To All -  Below is a lined version of the ICE contract marked to reflect the general comments I will be submitting to ICE.
As with the pricing, I do not anticipate that many of these changes will be acceptable to ICE, especially in light of recent events.
I welcome any additional suggestions or comments.
Thanks.
