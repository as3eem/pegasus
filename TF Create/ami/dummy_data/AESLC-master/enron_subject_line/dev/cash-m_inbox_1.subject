Michelle,  My previous email was recalled for a minor correction.
If you did receive the previous email, please replace it with the corrected attachments below.
Again, I have attached the Amendment to the Professional Services Addendum per your conference call with Jacqueline Barnette, the Siebel Corporate Counsel.
A copy of the Professional Services Addendum between Siebel and Enron is also attached as you requested.
If you have any additional questions or comments, please feel free to contact Jackie directly at (678) 319-4510.
