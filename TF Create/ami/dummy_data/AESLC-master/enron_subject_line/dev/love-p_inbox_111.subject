whats up man?
How are things with you?
Hearing all the news about Enron and all, figured I see how you are fairing.
I really hope that your not effected by all the bs.
We are doing well here.
Getting cold, but hey, its Norway right?
We have starting building a house and its going well.
I figure it will take about a year to get it all done.
I would like to do as much of the work myself, but I will see how long that goes.
Anyway, The Family and myself will be in Houston in late Feb.  We are having a small reception in Clear Lake and would love to see yall there if you can make it.
Let me here from you soon, hope all is well with you and the family.
Tell your moms whats up from me.
Tommy
