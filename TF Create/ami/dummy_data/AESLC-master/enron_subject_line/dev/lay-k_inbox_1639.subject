I have been an Enron stockholder for several years  and I am very disappoin= ted with the events of the last two weeks.
I find  the allegations of acco= unting irregularities incredible.
I would like to  know how closely the bo= ard had been monitoring the activities of the CFO and  whether it approved = the partnerships that have led to the SEC investigation and  the dramatic d= ecline in the company's stock price.
I would suggest that  the compensatio= n of senior management may be too heavily weighted towards  bonuses (giving=  some the incentive to manipulate the numbers to increase their  bonuses) a= nd not heavily weighted enough towards stock options.
I would  hope in the=  future the goals of the board and senior management will be aligned  with = stockholders (increasing shareholder value).
While I know it is not  reaso= n to have expected the stock price to stay in the high 80s, I consider the =  drop in the last two weeks (apparently as the result of fraud) to be  inex= cusable.
I believe the board owes all stockholders an explanation that  wi= ll finally clear the air about this mess (maybe the markets will trust Enro= n  again if it replaces evasion with candor).
Please help return credibili= ty  and ethics to this company, which apparently are badly needed.
