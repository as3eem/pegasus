Hi Paul,  Any luck with the draft of the ABB facility agreement form?
Looks like we  might have some business.
I have forwarded your draft of the turbine document to GE, but have not had  any comments.
I would like to set up a conference call with GE to discuss  it.
How is your schedule tomorrow or Monday?
Thanks,
