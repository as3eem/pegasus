Thank you for taking time to come to our Gas Logistics Staff meeting on Tuesday.
My apologies to those individuals that were inadvertently dropped from the email distribution.
I will schedule time to visit with anyone that missed the staff meeting.
I know that you are all still searching for answers to the Enron events of the last few weeks.
You asked lots of good questions at the meeting.
At the bottom of this email are responses to a few additional questions.
As I said at the meeting, while I am discouraged by recent events, I am really proud of ETS and of our Gas Logistics Team and I am looking forward to showing off our pipeline successes to the Dynegy management team in the future.
With the Thanksgiving holiday just around the corner, I'd like to take the opportunity to wish you and your family a safe and happy holiday season.
I hope that you can spend time with your families and friends away from the demands of work.
I'd also like to put two dates on your calendar to celebrate work accomplishments with our team.
