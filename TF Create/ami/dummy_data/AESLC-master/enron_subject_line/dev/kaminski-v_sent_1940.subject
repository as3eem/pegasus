Sherri,  Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy economics and finance in February of next year.
They would like very much to  have  Jeff Skilling as a keynote speaker.
Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend that Jeff speaks at this conference I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn a few times about this conference and  I think that this will be  an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and agenda for the future.
I shall send a separate message to Jeff about this request.
Vince
