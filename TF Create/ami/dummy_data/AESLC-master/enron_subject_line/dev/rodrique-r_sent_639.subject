Kathy,  Please review the spreadsheet guidelines I sent.
I am having to recreate  your text files every night.
Specifically, the master deal id should be a  unique number (an NA is not acceptable here), the date must be in the d-mm-yy  format not a julian date format, and there can be NO commas in any numbers.
Thanks,
