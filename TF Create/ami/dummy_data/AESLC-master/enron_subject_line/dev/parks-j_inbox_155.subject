Mertz called to see how the weekend went.
He is looking for new hunters.
He just kicked a guy off a 4,700 acre lease  and he had a guy go into bankrucy on a company lease on 5,400 acres.
He is  going to put an add in the houston chronicle.
If you guys know anyone  looking for a lease of that size, might want to call mertz for more info and  put them in touch.
He also suggested that he is still looking for a farmer to plant one field  in milo for dove hunting and one in fall vegetation for deer hunting.
If he  does one in milo, he was thinking he could use it for a little dove hunting  for himself and friends.
I told him we would probably not have a problem  with that arrangement in return for him getting the fields planted.
I'll  believe it when I see it.
