Mark, I found a good looking job at Anadarko.
(attached).
I believe the hiring supervisor is Bruce Stover who is the chairman of the University of Oklahoma Board of Visitors-College of Engineering where I went to school.
I think I should be able to match up with him but, I don't know him and need some help in getting into his office.
Do you know him and ( here is the big favor) know him well enough to get me into his office???
At any rate let me know what is going on with you in Denver.
This job hunting is like no fun at all.. .

Thanks,
