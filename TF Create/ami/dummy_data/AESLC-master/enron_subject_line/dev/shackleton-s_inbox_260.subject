Clint,  Per our discussions, we need to agree to some modifications to the confirmation this week in order to proceed with the roll.
These modifications involve making sure we can receive the cash due to us if you net share settle, and should not impact your accounting for the transactions.
This clauses are standard - I'm not sure how they got dropped from the confirmation.
Here is a blackline version of the confirm: <<Enron confirm blackline 9-26-01.doc>>  Best regards,
