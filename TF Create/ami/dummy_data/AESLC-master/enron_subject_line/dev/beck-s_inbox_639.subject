Sally,   here is a revised version of the savings for ENA, EGM, EIM, Back Office, Frameworks, and Corporate Systems.
There have been a number of changes as follows :-   Back Office The headcount numbers have changed because the original cuts took into account bugeted headcount counts rather than working from our currrent position.
Ramesh Rao spent some time today revising those figures to better represent what it will really take to address the three scenarios.
Also the changes reflect what it will take to support EA business only.
EES - at least, part of it - was supposed to be integrated into UNIFY early next year and therefore EES had a 20% allocation from the backoffice.
EGM/EIM Jeff made some slight alterations to make sure that current employee counts were accurate, and base cont/consultant headcount more on average budgeted for next year rather than actuals today.
They assumed in budgeting that contractors and consultants would be reduced next year as new dev in Thunderball, Freight and EIM started to be completed   The Summary page now shows savings rather than totals and all values are scaled to show millions....   regards
