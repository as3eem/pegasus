Attached is the consolidated list of counterparties for the week ending  12/3.
All other lists sent to you by various people this week can be  ignored.
If a counterpartys says "declined" by Credit, you don't need to  look at it.
If there is nothing in the box it means "approved" and, as of  today, look at "divisions" which means they are trading out of a division   The "division" issue is up in the air and is being looked at on a going  forward basis.
Per my agreeement with each of the physical groups, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU  IN ONE DAY, I WILL ASSUME THE COUNTERPARTY IS APPROVED TO TRADE ALL THE  PRODUCTS THAT CREDIT HAS APPROVED FOR THAT COUNTERPARTY.
We rarely expect  counterparty issues from the physical trading groups, most of the  counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties.
I  ONLY NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A COUNTERPARTY.
Most of the physical trading group's issues will revolve around which  contract to use, and that should be resolved directly with Global Contracts,  in the same way you resolve such issues on an "off-line" basis.
Credit is redoing the 12/6 and 12/7 lists they sent to me earlier, and I will  forward them to you as soon as I receive them.
