I believe we are in a position to finish this contract today (or tomorrow) = if=20 we can get buy in on the change in assignment highlighted in red below (las= t=20 paragraph of 22.2).
Previously, the unfettered right to assign arose at=20 Acceptance.
This change allows us the flexibility to pay for a unit and=20 assign it to anyone, and not have to wait until the unit is satisfactorily= =20 completed, installed, etc.=20  Please let me know if this change is ok, and if WestLB will be in a positio= n=20 to sign this agreement tomorrow.
Thanks,
