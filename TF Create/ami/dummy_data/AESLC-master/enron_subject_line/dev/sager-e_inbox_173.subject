Hi Liz,   It was fun catching up with you at  Dr.Injak's.
Like you, I married a geologist (my dad and brother-in-law are  also geologists).
It's a nice change from lawyers.
I hope Sam is doing OK.  What did the doctor  say to do for him?
Let me know what your schedule is like and we can  meet some time.
I'm fairly flexible, but have a nanny only 2 days per  week, so the rest of the time Connor is with me.
My little  shadow.
Ciao, Kathy Ellis Cook
