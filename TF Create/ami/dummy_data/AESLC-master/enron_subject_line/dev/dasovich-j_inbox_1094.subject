Hi Jeff, attached is the statement of services for Enron for November.
These have previously been sent to Sue Mara.
However, with her departure, it seemed best to send it to you.
As you probably know, our agreement was that the advice letter review service would terminate as of the end of December.
That's why I have been continuing to review the utility filings and send you summaries.
If the bankruptcy filing means something different for this arrangement, please let me know.
Thanks, and I hope you and your family have a wonderful holiday season and a healthy, happy and prosperous 2002!
Dan
