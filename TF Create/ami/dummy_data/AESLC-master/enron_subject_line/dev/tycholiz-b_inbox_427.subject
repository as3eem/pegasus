Mr. Tycholiz:  I represent SCE's Energy Supply and Marketing Department with respect to the above-referenced subject.
It is my understanding that the account number in Section 2 of the Transaction Agreement Regarding Collateral ("Agreement") is incorrect.
I propose that the parties correct the error by lining out the incorrect number and inserting by hand the correct one.
I have drafted and attached a letter agreement reflecting that intention.
Please review and call me at your earliest opportunity so tht we may discuss further.
Thank you.
