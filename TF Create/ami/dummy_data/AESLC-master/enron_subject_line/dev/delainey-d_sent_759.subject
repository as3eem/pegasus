FYI, Ken we may want you to speak to Peevey and Freeman.
I believe that  discussion should frame the proposal and attempt to set up a meeting with his  staff and advisors to answer questions about credit and documentation.
In  the propsal, we have tried to frame the potential credit and legal holes in  their RFP with our suggested language or documents.
It would be helpful for  the commercial team in ENA/EES to meet with these gentlemen and their  advisors to describe the proposal and perhaps move towards negotiating a  transaction.
The proposal includes:   a) traded power products of various sizes and terms;   b) unit contigent tolls from Pastoria (750MW) and Las Vegas Cogen (222MW)  for term;   c) natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide  gas hedges for their QF portfolio or other contracted merchant toll contracts;   and d) an preliminary proposal on DSM from EES.
I will forward an executive summary from Chris Calger with more detail.
Regards
