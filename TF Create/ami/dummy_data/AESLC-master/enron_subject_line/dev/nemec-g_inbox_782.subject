Shane, 	Sandi has initialed Tennessee's TPA form because of time restraints, but asked that this form be worked on in the future.
Had she had time before the move, Sandi would have liked to change this form before initialing on ENA and ENA Upstream's behalf.
Sandi called John discussing her concerns, therefore, if you have any questions, John may know the answers.
Two originals are being sent to your attention for further execution.
If you have any questions, please call me at x35231.
Thank You,
