Mark & Scott,  As there has been significant changes at Enron over the last few months, I wanted to revisit employment opportunities at Enron.
With change comes opportunity and I hope both of you have been able to adequately capitalize.
My resume has been updated to reflect the work I have completed this year.
As for my immediate schedule, I will be engaged in a consultancy assignment in Europe until November 9, 2001.
Thereafter, my schedule appears to be open.
I am hopeful we will be able to talk again soon.
