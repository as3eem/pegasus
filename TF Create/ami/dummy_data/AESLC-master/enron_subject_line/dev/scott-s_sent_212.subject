Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably  (i.e.
subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would  amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can  acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.
Their chief concern is to prevent TW from  becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never  been our intention).
Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether  this is something we could live with.
The Commission has expressed the same  concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our  proposal too.
Comments?
let me know.
