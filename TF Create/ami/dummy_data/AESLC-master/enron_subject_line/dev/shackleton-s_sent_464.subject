In an effort to establish regular communication on the progress of trading  issues (primarily related legal and tax perspectives)  in the S. Cone, Lynn  and I have agreed to conference on Friday, October 15 at 9 am (Houston time)  and weekly at that time.
Would anyone else like to participate this Friday?
If you are interested in participating on a weekly basis, are Fridays at 9 am  (Houston time) convenient for you?
My immediate concerns are financial  trading issues.
However, we can focus on all relevant issues as we so  determine.
I will create a "short list" to initiate discussion.
Thanks.
Sara
