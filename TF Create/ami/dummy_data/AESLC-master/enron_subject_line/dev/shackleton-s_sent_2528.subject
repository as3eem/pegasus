Matt and Denis:  I spoke with Matthew Flett about an hour ago and he advised that  EnronCredit.com Limited had finalized its ISDA.
I requested a copy burt he  has not yet sent it over.
Both ENE and ENA want to execute masters with MSCS  and we would like to work from your document.
Can you email me a copy?
Thanks.
Sara
