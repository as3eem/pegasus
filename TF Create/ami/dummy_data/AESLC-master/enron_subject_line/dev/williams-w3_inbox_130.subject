Bill,  Kirk from LADWP called back just after I talked to you.
In that conversation he appoligized twice for the previous conversation.
Thus I dont think we need to pull the tapes for the conversation he and I had unless it is for your own amusement.
Being that he realized he was wrong and appologized I wouldnt want to jeopardize any future realationship with LADWP over one instance with him as he has been okay in the past.
However you will need to still pull the tapes for Geirs conversation which occured somewhere between 16:00 and 17:30.
Thanks.
