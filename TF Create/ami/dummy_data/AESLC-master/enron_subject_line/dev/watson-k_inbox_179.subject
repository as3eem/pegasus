Attached is an executive summary of the NOI on Electronic Service of Documents, RM01-11.
Essentially, FERC wants to expand service electronically to allow individuals to receive documents through email without the need for interventions just to be kept informed of the proceedings.
FERC is making two proposals, one for service to parties and one for service to individuals for a cost (FERC states cost recovery but no specifics).
Comments are due November 2.
Joe has asked that I coordinate comments for our pipelines.
Let me know who you wish to participate.
