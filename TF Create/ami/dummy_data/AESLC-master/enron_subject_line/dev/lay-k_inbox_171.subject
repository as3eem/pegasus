Hi Ken Louise and Jeff,  Attached are the links to the multimedia cases Harvard prepared in association with the cases recently written, excerpted from the videos they took of the 3 of you a few months ago.
I'm remotely  accessing this while travelling and have been unable to open the videos.
This is likely a function of the remote connection.
Ken and Jeff, I'll review each of yours when I'm better able to access.
I'll then  provide you my comments (if any), as you will need to sign off on the release and use of these by Harvard.
Louise, will you please review at least your portion?
Thanks!
