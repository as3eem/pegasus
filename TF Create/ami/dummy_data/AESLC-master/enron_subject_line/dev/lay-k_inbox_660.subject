I'm a recent EBS redeployment person who found a job in ETS.
Late last week my group got flat screen monitors to replace the old, large, bulky ones.
We moved to 3 Allen Center on Monday evening 9/17.
On Tuesday evening, 9/18 someone came into this area and stole 2 of the new flat screen monitors.
This is being investigated, however, we now have 2 persons without a monitor.
What is happening to all the computer equipment from EBS terminated/redeployed persons?
If we had access to this equipment, the monitors could be quickly replaced.
Instead, 2 old, large bulky monitors are being delivered as a "temporary" fix while ETS orders new equipment.
Why is ETS ordering new equipment when a transfer of computer assets from EBS to ETS could speedily resolve this problem?
All Enron companies could benefits if the unused equipment from EBS was recycled back into Enron.
