Attached is an Excel spreadsheet comparing fuel used between Red Rock and propose Sun Devil projects.
The Phoenix delivery of 500 MMcf/d is locked and the Cal.
border deliveries decrease in 10% increments down to 60%.
If you look at the mainline fuel use only, there is a decrease in fuel used per flowing volume.
If you have any questions, please call.
