Mike,  I placed the adjusted L/R Balance on the Enronwest site.
It is under the "Staff/Kourtney Nelson".
There are two links:    1)  "Adj L_R" is the same data/format from the weekly strategy meeting.
2)  "New Gen 2001_2002" link has all of the supply side info that is used to calculate the L/R balance
