Jeff was able to create a Netco file under O:\erms\erms_adm without an erequest.
There is a file for each region out there now.
I will save the new p&l to each region but could each of you please pick an p&l from your region as a back-up just in case.
these are the files I know of  Exotica P&L Hedgestrips All excel queries Weapon-X & new version Access financial reports Exotics file Transport model Curve files   Do you guys have anything else?
