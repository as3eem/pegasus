I will be passing out ETS' (mailing Omaha's to Ann for distribution) updated wallet-size phone list.
The list includes blackberry numbers.
Below, please find directions to set your blackberrys to be notified of only high priority messages.
All other messages will reach your blackberry, but you will not be disturbed by routine messages.
A person notifying you will have to indicate that the message is high priority.
If you have any problems, let me know.
1.
Run the Desktop Manager;  2.
Double click on Redirector Settings; 3.
Select the Filters tab; 4.
Select New; 5.
Type a filter name (whatever you makeup for this exercise), click on Importance and change drop down box to High.
Click the box Forward with Level 1 Notification; 6.
Click ok, apply, ok; 7.
Now go to the handheld device and choose Options.
Choose Notify, then move down to Level 1 Notify Only and make sure it indicates Yes.
