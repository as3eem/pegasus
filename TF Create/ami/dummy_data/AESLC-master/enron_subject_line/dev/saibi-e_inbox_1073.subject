Ercot Traders:  I will be out of the office beginning tomorrow and returning on Monday, Nov 19th.
While I'm out, please contact Tim Carter (he sits to my right) with any questions you might have.
If there is anything I can address for you before I go, I will be in the office until about 2:30 today.
Thanks and I'll see you when I get back!
Andrea
