Adele:  Here is a draft of a letter agreement amending the online Electronic Trading  Agreement.
Please let me know if it is ok and I will have a copy executed  and faxed over to you.
My apologies for the delay - I thought I had sent this to you last week but I  can't find any record of it so I must not have done it.
