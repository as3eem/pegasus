The lawsuit was filed at 11:06 a.m.
The next thing to do is to get MSN formally served.
To do that, we have to get citation issued (we are working with the court personnel to expedite this process) and serve the papers on MSN's registered agent in Austin.
We are trying to do that as quickly as possible  -- hopefully, by the end of the day.
Please do not mention the lawsuit to MSN until I notify you that formal service has been accomplished.
