Hey don,  1.
We have a new solution for the db which will work in outlook.
They wanted to know if we will still need the historical data and they will need to check if we are allowed to take that data.
Do we need the data?
Do we still have business from that when we become UBS?
2.
Please put in an erequest for a public folder.
Goto erequest and choose applications/ms outlook/public folder...put notes that you will use to replace old "east power trading" ln db.
Let me know so I can get it done.
