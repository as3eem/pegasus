Sean, thank you for your rent deposit yesterday.
I really appreciate your timeliness.
I will be in Portland Sat Jan 26 to Wed Jan 30 for business reasons.
I need to have an electrician install smoke detectors per the new code effective the first of January + I want to get the phone jack fixed in the guest bedroom.
I also need to meet with the landscaper about pruning the back hedge.
I'll be up to my ears in business meetings all day Monday and Tuesday morning.
I was thinking about making appointments for the electrician and the landscaper for Tuesday afternoon.
I will be there to let them know what I need to have done so I can give them access.
Is that ok with you?
Is there anything else that needs attention?
Hope life isn't too crazy for you with all the press Enron is getting these days.
Deborah
