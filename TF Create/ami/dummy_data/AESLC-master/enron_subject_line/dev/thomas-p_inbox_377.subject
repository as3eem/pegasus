Two items of note with regard to NYISO:  - 	On November 5, 2001, PSEG Energy Resources & Trade filed a complaint against the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO), requesting that the Commission restore the original market clearing prices for energy for May 9, 2000.
PSEG claims that NYISO violated its tariff and Commission orders approving Temporary Extraordinary Procedure (TEP) authority by 1) identifying a purported market flaw associated with bids submitted by an Energy Limited Resource and 2) remedying the market flaw by re-pricing certain hourly clearing prices in a manner inconsistent with its tariff on May 8 & 9, 2000.
PSEG was a seller in the real time market on May 9, 2000 and lost revenues as a result of NYISO's Extraordinary Corrective Action.
Interventions and protests are due by November 26, 2001.
(EL02-16-000)  -	On November 16, 2001, NYISO filed a request for a stay of the Commission's decision to require the NYISO to re-bill for operating reserves for March 2000, pending the NYISO's appeal of that decision.
In March 2000, NYISO made an "exigent circumstances" filing seeking the imposition of various bidding restrictions to prevent alleged market power abuses.
The Commission's order only partially granted NYISO's request, and did not allow NYISO to re-calculate March 2000 operating reserves prices.
The Commission has not yet issued any notice of the filing.
