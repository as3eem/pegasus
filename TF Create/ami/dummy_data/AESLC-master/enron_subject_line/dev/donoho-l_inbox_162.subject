For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to "sponsor" every child in that school.
What we mean by "sponsor" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.
The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.
For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.
I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.
Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.
But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.
We need more help!!!
