Concerning ProLiance,  we have tried in the recent past to negotiate with  much difficulty a Master Gas Purchase Sale Agreement  with this customer.
There are significant credit and legal issues surrounding  ProLiance.
Enron  Credit has refused to grant a line of credit as a result of these issues and  will not ok a GISB.
In addition,  ProLiance has proven to be most  unreasonable with regards to terms in the Master.
Please give Russell Diamond or I a call if you have any questions and or  comments about ProLiance.
