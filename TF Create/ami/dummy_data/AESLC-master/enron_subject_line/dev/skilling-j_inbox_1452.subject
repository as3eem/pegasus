Mr. Skilling,  As with the many employees here at Enron, I wish you all the best ahead.
I'm sorry to hear you leave but I know you have your reasons.
I'm sure we all can respect that.
I just wanted to send you a note to say thanks again for the things you've done for me since last summer.
They're greatly appreciated.
Hopefully, I will have the chance to meet with you again.
Wishing you the best and hopefully I will see you again....  Kindest regards,  Tim Ng Analyst x30998
