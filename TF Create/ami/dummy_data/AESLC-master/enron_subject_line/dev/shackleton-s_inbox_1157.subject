Sara, Thanks for your suggested changes.
I left the commercial support requirement on the account because I think it is a good control.
However, if you do want to remove this requirement because of shrinking staffs,  I am okay with that.
Please change as required, initial and circulate for signatures.
Thanks.
Sheila
