Gloria,  I need to have a redline generated by Comparwrite, as I don't have it loaded  locally.
The original document is in my Fuel Cell/Equipment contract file,  and has the same name as the one below, only it is dated October11 (I believe  rev 2).
The new document is the one below.
Please save the redline verision  in the same directory, and email the redlined document to me, Heather Kroll,  Scott Healy, and Stephen Plauche ASAP.
Thanks,
