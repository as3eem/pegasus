Attached is a further installment of the EWS Tax Update summarizing the many transactions supported by the EWS Tax Department during the past month.
To say the least, the past month has seen a flurry of activity and the EWS Tax Department has worked diligently to insure that all of Enron's business is provided the highest quality tax support and that Enron's tax expense is minimized.
Please do not hesitate to call me at x30938 to discuss any of the described transactions.
Best regards to all.
SHD.
