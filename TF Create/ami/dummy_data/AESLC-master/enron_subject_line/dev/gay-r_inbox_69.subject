Most of you already know, but the move is taking place this Friday 11/16/01.
Please be sure you are packed by 3:00 PM on Friday and  have everything labeled.
They are moving both Power and Gas, so I am not sure what time the building will be open on Sunday or if it will be open at all.
I will get back to you with that information by Thursday.
If you have any questions or need help with anything, please let me know.
Thanks!
