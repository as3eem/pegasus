To ensure a smooth flow of bank resolutions to the necessary signatories, I  am requesting that Enron Treasury first route the bank resolutions to Angela  Davis (EWS Legal) to be initialed before being routed to John Lavorato or  Louise Kitchen.
If you have any questions please call me at 3-6544.
Thank you for your  attention to this matter.
