Don, in my opinion options 1 & 2 are the same and 3 is not an option.
I  would like to provide an outsourcing deal that earns us fees and provides  information.
We will manage the internal issues.
A properly priced and  scoped term outsourcing deal should be doable.
Please speak with Sally Beck  and Beth Perleman.
