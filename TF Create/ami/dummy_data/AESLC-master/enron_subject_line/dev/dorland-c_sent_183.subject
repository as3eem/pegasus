Torrey/Mark,  Below is the error message Chris gets when logging in to EOL.
If we hit Yes  it keeps coming back with the same error.
(Sometimes it works though... you  figure it out).
If you hit No, the browser session freezes up.
We have done the following:  Uninstalled/Reinstalled Shockwave Reinstalled browser   Please look at this ASAP since he needs to be able to see the customer screen.
Thanks,
