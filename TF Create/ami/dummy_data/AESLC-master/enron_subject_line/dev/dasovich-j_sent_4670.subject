Michael Tribolet and I (about 99% Michael) have put together a rough cut  analysis of the core/noncore structure, and some scenarios Hertzberg has  asked for.
Hertzberg's expecting some info from us on Monday (and I'm sure  that he'll want more scenarios, too).
Are you available first thing Monday  morning to be briefed on the analysis, my conversations with Hertzberg, what  Hertzberg's strategy is, etc.
?
