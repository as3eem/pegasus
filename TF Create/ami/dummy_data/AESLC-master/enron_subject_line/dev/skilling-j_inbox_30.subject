Jeff,  My name is Samuel Pak, and I'm an Analyst in the A/A program.
I will also be riding the MS150 with you and the Team this weekend.
As I did last year, I am writing an article on the MS150 for the Encounter.
As such, I was hoping that maybe we could chat a few minutes at lunch in Bellville or at dinner in La Grange.
If this is OK with you, I will find you and introduce myself, and we can go from there.
Much Thanks!
Sam.
