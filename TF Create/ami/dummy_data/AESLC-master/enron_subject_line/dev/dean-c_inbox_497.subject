Good Morning,  Last Tuesday I attended the OATI training on E-Tag 1.7 in Houston.
Although this new tagging won't be implemented until March, we will have access to the Test site sometime in November or December.
This new way of tagging is very different from what we have now, and each group that makes tags is going to have to allow time for practice.
Also, because the format of the new tags is so different, the old templates will not work.
New templates will need to be created.
Please let me know if you want to have formal training sessions, and I will work up a series of them for January and February.
Thanks,
