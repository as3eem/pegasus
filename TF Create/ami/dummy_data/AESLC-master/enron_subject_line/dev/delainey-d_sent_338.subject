Guys, it is my understanding that the incremental $5 MM in gas V@R, under an  interim authority, expires today.
Given current market conditions, I would  request  an extension of that interim limit - $45MM in total gas V@R for an  additional two weeks starting today.
Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional  permanent increases for gas and power V@R particularily given the Alberta  PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the  winter season.
I will take your lead on this one.
Regards
