RE: Media Preparedness Session, June 12, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Doubletree Hotel, Lamar Room (downtown)  Team   You may be wondering what our Media Preparedness Session on June 12 is about.
Here's the logic...    We are in the enviable position of having significant media interest in the genius behind EnronOnline and our mid/back office services while, at the same time, we are trying to leverage our e-commerce reputation at Net Works.
We can use this to our commercial advantage, e.g.
advertising without the expense.
Dealing with the media, however, can be like getting behind the wheel of a race car with no training -- you might have fun for a while but eventually crash.
That's why it's important that we set aside some time to get ready for the race.
