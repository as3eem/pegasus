The copier Coconut Telegraph has been out of service this morning.
It should be back up and running momentarily, but all jobs sent to it have had to be deleted.
If you sent a print job to Coconut Telegraph today, please be advised that you will need to resend or send to Barometer Soup instead.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
Thanks for your patience while we get this straightened out.
