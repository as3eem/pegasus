John,  Enron owns two GE 7EA turbines, which may be sold in a structure similiar to  the CA Development structure.
We would like to update the letter agreements  to address this possibility, and would appreciate K & S's assistance in that  regard.
The counterparties are not yet known, but I have heard Evista and Cayuga  mentioned.
If this sounds good to you, I will initiate the approval process for your  retention in this matter.
Thanks,
