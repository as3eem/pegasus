ATTENTION: Haas Computing Services has been made aware of a software problem that has  occurred with the IZIO system.
The problem has caused  some of, and in  some cases, all of the course information that had been previously  populated, to be deleted.
We are aware of this problem and are attempting  to resolve is ASAP.
We ask that, if you are affected, that you send an  email message to the helpdesk with your course information that is  missing.
Also, we ask that you give us the opportunity to resolve this  problem, and NOT come to the Computing Services Front Desk, with a deluge  of complaints.
We understand your frustration, and are working quickly to resolve this  matter.
Once resolved, you will receive another memo indicating  such.
Again, thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
