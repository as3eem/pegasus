Stewart:  I spoke with Jeff and he will arrange a conference call next week with the  tribe's CFO and legal counsel.
I highlighted the "eligibility" (eligible to  enter into swaps under the CFTC regulations) and jurisdictional issues for  Jeff regarding Indian tribes.
Of course, all of the other governmental  counterparty concerns are here as well.
The tribe is located in Oregon.
I'll follow up with you next week.
