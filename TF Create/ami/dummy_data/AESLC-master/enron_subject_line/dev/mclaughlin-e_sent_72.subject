Agustin,  Per our discussion on Friday, I have changed this deal so that Enron is  selling leg 1.
I can't remember.
Did you say that we have already received  a check back from the counterparty?
Let me know, b/c this deal has price and  basis and I'm sure the desk that had the basis risk wants the money owed them.
Thanks,
