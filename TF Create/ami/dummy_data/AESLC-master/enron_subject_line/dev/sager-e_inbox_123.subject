Elizabeth,  Just as an FYI, I have spoken with Marty Jo at Entergy-Koch.
I tried to explain to her that we are not disagreeing to sign Entergy-Koch's confirm when they are seller, how we would just like for their confirmation to reflect the example confirmation within the EEI agreement.
I also mentioned to her that I had sent their confirmation for review to our attorney David Portz and I expressed the changes that needed to be made to their confirmation to their back office.
I have attached the EEI agreement just in case.
She mentioned at the very being of our conversation that she would like to discuss the issue with you.
Please call with any questions x33031.
Regards,
