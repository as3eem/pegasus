Dear Friends,  Over the next three weeks Technology For All-Houston (TFA-Houston) will distribute 162 computers to Houston area community based organizations serving the underserved.
Pam Gardner, our Program Assistant, has prepared an excellent summary of the organizations receiving computers and how they will be utilized.
When these distributions are complete, TFA-Houston will have helped 108 Houston area community based organizations develop community technology centers since 1998.
We are especially thankful for the corporate computer donations that make this possible, including the most recent donation from Shell.
