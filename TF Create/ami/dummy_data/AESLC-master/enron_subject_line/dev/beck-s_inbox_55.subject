Dave Delaney and Jim Fallon need the following information for a meeting tomorrow at noon.
They need to know which BU all ENW and ISC employees support (i.e.
EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, and ENA).
I've provided all the employees that remain in the estate in the spreadsheet below for you.
There's a tab for each of you with all of your Estate employees listed.
Please designate which company each employee supports and return by 11 AM tomorrow.
I apologize for the short notice.
Thanks for your help.
