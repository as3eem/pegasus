Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.
Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.
Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.
First, let's take a look at the survey results.
In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.
I sincerely appreciate your participation.
I.
We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.
The responses were:  1.
Stock price 2.
The PRC 3.
Employee/internal morale 4.
External reputation and image 5.
"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
