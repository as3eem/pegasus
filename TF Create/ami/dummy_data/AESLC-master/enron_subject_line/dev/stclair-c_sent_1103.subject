Janette: I need to meet with both Marks to finalize the details on my return to work.
I'm happy to come to the office to meet with them.
Next week, the only day  that is not good is next Tuesday.
I think that we need about 1 hour.
Could  you please check with Mark Taylor's secretary and then let me know what works  best for Mark H. and Mark T.?
Thanks.
