Are we still considering adding ETS-owned generation at one or more of the TW  compressor stations in Arizona or NM?
In case that is still a possibility,  let me pass on something we may want to follow up on.
I called an old law  partner of mine from DC who is now in the generation development business  this week to have lunch and catch up.
This guy says he has come up with a  good formula for getting new generation built fast and cheap.
He's got an  80mw nameplate simple cycle project (two frame 6 turbines) under development  in Utah that he started development on a month ago and is projected to go in  service on July 1.
Pretty quick work compared to other projects I've seen.
Here's his racket:  1.
He gets used, first quality turbines that have been well maintained.
His  Utah turbines are something like 2 year old GE units that he bought from  Tokyo Electric (he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in  typical electric utility gold plated style).
He didn't say, but I suspect  there is no warranty on the units.
Obviously, this isn't a bold new  strategy, but this guy claims to have a good handle on available used  equipment.
2.
His siting/permitting strategy is to use "brownfield" sites--i.e.,
