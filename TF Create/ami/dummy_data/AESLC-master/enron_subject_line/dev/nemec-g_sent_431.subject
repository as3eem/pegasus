Attached is the EnergyShare 2000 Agreement with my revisions included.
Included is both a clean and redlined version.
I did not review in detail  the payment calculation methodology.
I will leave this to Mark Courtney and  John Scarborough for their review.
Please feel free to call me at (713)  853-3512 if you have any questions or wish to discuss my revisions.
