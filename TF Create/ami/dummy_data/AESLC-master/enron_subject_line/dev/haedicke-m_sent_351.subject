Michael:  The September ISDA meeting is coming up and I am starting to plan my  schedule.
I will be in London on Monday and Tuesday, Sept 12 and 13.
I will  also be in Frankfurt on Wednesday and Thursday.
Are you free for dinner on  either Monday or Tuesday?
Who is the best person in Frankfurt to give me an  overview of the trading markets in Germany?
Regards,
