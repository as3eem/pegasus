Thank you for the opportunity to meet this morning.
I spoke bluntly.
Please know that it is because of my confidence in you and the rest of our management team that I felt inspired to do so.
If we can have frank discussions in times like these, we will emerge even stronger.
Thank you for standing up there and taking the heat.
