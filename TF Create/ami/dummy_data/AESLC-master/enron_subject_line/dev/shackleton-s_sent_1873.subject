Brent:  Just a reminder, we track all trading agreements in our Lotus Notes  database (you can enter negotiating issues, etc.).
Samantha oversees this  part of the database, updates Ted Murphy and has the agreements executed and  filed.
All trading agreements are signed by Ted and the business unit VP.
Please keep Samanthat in the loop.
Thanks.
Sara
