Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have  these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.
I think all you need  to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;     "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".
If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they  send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.
Let me know if you have any questions.
thanks
