On September 20, 2001, ISO New England filed amendments to the Special Interim Market Rule.
The amendments would extend bid caps or price limitations: 1) from periods of capacity deficiencies to all markets for all hours and 2) from October 31, 2001 until October 31, 2002.
If you would like further information, please let me know.
