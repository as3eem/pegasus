Susan:  Please prepare a draft ISDA for the above parties with:  (1)  no CSA  and (2)  bilateral cross-default at US$100 million.
I am presently reviewing  CP comments to the ENA master and may have some changes for you tomorrow.
We  will send this out on Tuesday.
Clint:  First Union Securities Inc. is the bank's marketing arm and is NOT  the correct ISDA counterparty.
