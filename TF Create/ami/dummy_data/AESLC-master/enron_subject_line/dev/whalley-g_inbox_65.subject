Greg,  Just thought I'd share with you that I was Joe's chauffeur from the airport last night.
We had a great visit and he was a wonderful speaker for our tri-service academy dinner.
He was extremely complimentary of you as well.
Perhaps I can book you in advance for next year!!
Also, I was driving through Southern California last week and saw a tractor / trailer with a load marked "Enron Wind".
An hour later I drove through the prop-covered hills.
What an awesome display.
I know you're swamped, but when you have a chance to come up for air, let me know when you're up for a visit.
