market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Market Participants  Note:  The following change was originally scheduled for October 17, 2001.
On October 31, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.
This will require both software and hardware changes.
While these changes will be transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.
The outage will begin at approximately 11:35 AM.
Market Participants planning on submitting HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.
The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.
Ultimately, these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced services that the current web servers are unable to perform.
