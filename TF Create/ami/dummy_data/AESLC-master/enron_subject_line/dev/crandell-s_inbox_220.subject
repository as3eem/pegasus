Stewart,  Per our discussion I have changed Modesto basis option deal #520328 to reflect the restructured terms:  * original peak deal (leg 1) deal end date was changed from 9/30/01 to 8/5/01.
* new leg 3 was created for 8/6/01-9/30/01.
All terms stay the same except that strike price was changed to $3 and an extra premium was added for $2/MWh for the new leg.
I have also put a note in the comment field requesting the confirm group to send documents to you before sending to counterparty.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
