Carol:  John sent the email to all paralegals after he and I spoke in the  morning (6/2) since we didn't know who would handle.
I remember, now, I  checked the log in book while Susan was at lunch and it wasn't there so when  I asked her about it, she told me she was holding a prior confirm for Twister  ( apparently inactive until further notice) and she was now going to handle  this one.
I reminded her that I was leaving early to fly to NO so that I'd  have enough time to review.
The rest is history.
