Just wanted to follow up on one thing from our conversation on Friday.
In Sept, you need the 3rd current estimate, but are ok with us providing it to you the week of the 17th, rather than the 13th.
And this will be the 3rd current estimate, not just the normal cash flow forecast?
Then in October, we are back to the normal cash flow forecast, correct?
Let me know, thanks!
