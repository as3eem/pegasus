We are planning a party!
It has been a while since the group has had a party,  and my daughter is going to be a year old.
So we are  planning a party for November 11th, and Vandhana  and I would like to invite everyone in Research and  their family.
As yet we do not have the venue fixed, but please  keep November 11 (Sunday) free.
Please RSVP so that we can plan on the numbers.
Regards,
