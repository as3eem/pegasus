I understand that you may be in the Houston office at some point this week.
If so, I would like to get a few minutes on your schedule to talk about South  American Legal staffing issues.
Could you give me a call (713-853-7459) or  drop me an e-mail with what might work for you?
If you are not actually in  the office but have some time to talk on the phone, that would work too.
Thanks,
