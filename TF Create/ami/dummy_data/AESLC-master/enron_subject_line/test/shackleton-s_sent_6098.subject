We will keep the 10 am meeting on Tuesday, April 24, EB 38C2 (legal and  credit only).
We will also schedule a meeting at 3 pm (same day after legal/credit regular  meeting) with Fred, Caroline, Russell Dyk and Robyn Zivic.
Fred could not  meet in the morning and he is an integral part of the process we are trying  to develop for hedge funds.
I apologize if all of the lawyers cannot meet at  3 pm but at least one lawyer in attendance should keep us on track.
