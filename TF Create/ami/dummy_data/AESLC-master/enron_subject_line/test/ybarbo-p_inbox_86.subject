Dan,  Have just been in a meeting with our technical people regarding the sticky steam maneuvre control valve, those steamleakages in the boiler and cleaning the flame arrestores in gas supply line.
We are sorry to say that the vessel need abt 48 hrs to carry out the necessary work on the steam plant in order to minimize the steam leakage and having service on the steam maneuvre control valve.
As you know, we need some hrs to cool down the boilers/steam valve/pipes before it is possible  to open and to work with, after both boilers are been shut down.
To cooldown the steam plant take abt 10-12 hrs and to bring the plant into service again can take abt 6 hrs, so that means that we need 48 hrs, as mentioned above, to get our maintenace plan carried out.
According to the obervations done, last on the stopp last night, were the valve operated without any problems, we believe that the valve can be fixed without totaly dismantling.
On the other hand,if the valve has to be completely dismanteled, the work can take more than the expected 2 days.
We believe that the chance of this situation is slim.
Our schedule are: Eta Algeciras 30/4 0500 Etd Algeciras  2/5 0900 Eta Port Said  6/5 1830 Etd Suez       7/5 1700 Eta Qalhat    13/5 0900 Etd Qalhat    14/5 2400  Kindly advice if this can be worked out.
Best regards
