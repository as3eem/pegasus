We are short at PGE system for Thursday and Friday, 9/27-28/01.
HE15-20pdt, we are 25mw short (total of 150mw short each day).
This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk.
Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible.
Deal #791433.1 for both days.
Thanks,
