Ken, this is Pat Koenig.
I just wanted to send you a quick email and let you know you have my admiration and support ( I know it isn't much).
You have made Enron a great company, and no matter how bad the press gets I will always be proud to say my husband works for Enron and he works for the best, Ken Lay.
Pat
