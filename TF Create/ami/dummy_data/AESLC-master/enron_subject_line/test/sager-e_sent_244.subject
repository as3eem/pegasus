Hi Phil Just want to make arrangements for Sam's party Sat, at the zoo, at 1000 with  the Foelbers( no parent), Millers(no parent) and you'all  - You are invited  with the girls and could meet us at the zoo or, if you want a more leisurely  morning, we could pick up Eleanor and/or Alice and bring them home.
If we  were to pick them up, we would swing around about 945.
Let me know what you  would like.
thanks
