Can you please set this new location up, Nipsco/NGPL, with curves the same as  the original point, NGPL/Nipsco.
I believe they are as follows: gas daily  should be GDP-CHI.
GATE, the intramonth should be NGI/CHI.
GATE, and the Mid  should be NGI/CHI./NIPSCO.
Please shout with any questions.
Thanks for your help.
