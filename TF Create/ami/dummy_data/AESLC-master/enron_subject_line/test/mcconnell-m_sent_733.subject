Jeff,   FYI, I just got this from Tom.
We don't have a very big opportunity here!
Tom did tell me that his numbers were going to be difficult to get.
Not that  i don't want to put $5 trillion on our chart, but what do you think we should  put as market size?
Nat gas, power and our existing verticals only?
What do  you think?
He is the only one to give me a number yet.
I am going to discuss it at the  staff meeting.
Mike
