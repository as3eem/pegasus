A great editorial in the Wall Street Journal today.
Manager's Journal: What Enron Did Right By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner  11/19/2001 The Wall Street Journal A20 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    This is a rough era for American business icons.
Subject to the vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business.
The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.
Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest.
The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage.
We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.
We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed.
High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms.
But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.
