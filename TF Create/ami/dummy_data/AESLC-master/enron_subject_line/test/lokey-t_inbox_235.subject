I will be walking in the Juvenile Diabetes walk on October 28 and am soliciting sponsors.
If you would like to donate to this cause, please let me know.
For a donation of $25 or more, you will get an Enron JDRF Team T-shirt with our "Mission Possible" theme.
As we all know, Juvenile Diabetes is a disease that affects many children and adults alike.
Insulin is not a cure, only a drug that keeps them alive until a cure is found and a cure is within walking distance.
Please help if you can.
Thanks,
