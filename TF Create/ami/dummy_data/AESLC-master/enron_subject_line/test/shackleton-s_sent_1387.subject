Mark and Paul:  ENA has just finalized an ISDA Master Agreement with  Statoil.
I had advised you several months ago that Statoil also wanted to  negotiate with ECTRIC, using the ENA agreement as a model.
Chuck O'Brien is  the inhouse counsel and can be reached via email or phone (203/978-6988).
Please contact Chuck and let me know if there is anything that I can do to  help.
Regards.
Sara  Chuck:  Mark and Paul can be reached in London at 011-44-20-7783-6552 (Mark)  and 011-44-20-7783-6566 (Paul).
