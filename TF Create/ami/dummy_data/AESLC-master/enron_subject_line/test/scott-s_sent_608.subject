Hey Darren,  I wanted to try and touch and base with you before my arrival in London.
I  talked to Emily late last week and she seemed to think Friday night was a  good night to try and get together.
I know you have a bunch of people that  are going to be in London this weekend, but maybe we could just make it one  big group outing.
Get back to me when you get a chance and we'll try and set  something up.
Susan
