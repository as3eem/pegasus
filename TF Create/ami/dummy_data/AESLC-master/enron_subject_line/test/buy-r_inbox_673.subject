After close discussions with David Port and the RAC-Market Risk group, we have redesigned the Business Unit and Commodity DPR's to follow the new Risk Trading Policy.
This new policy took effect Wednesday, the 15th of August, and required a restructuring of the Business Unit structures and associated limits, along with creation of new Concentration limits on the Concentration DPR, formerly the Commodity DPR.
For any questions about the new format, please contact Shona Wilson, x39123, or myself, x33102, in the Global Risk Operations group, or David Port, x39823, in the RAC-Market Risk group.
Thank you,
