Dear Bros.,     I'm happy to announce Grumps came through his angioplasty procedure today with flying colors.
The artery in question was, in fact, 100% blocked and they successfully unblocked it with the balloon.
Bro's Benson, Walker and I were there to lend moral support to Linda, as was Grump's Pastor and Associate Pastor.
Always thought God and Wooglin made for a fairly formidable duo.
Grumps was a different man after so many of you called and expressed your concern, support and love.
He was indeed very much afraid, as would be anybody, but your thoughts and well-wishes provided immeaurable morale building at a time when he most needed it.
Thanks again guys.
He'll be playing golf within a week.
Yours in -kai-,
