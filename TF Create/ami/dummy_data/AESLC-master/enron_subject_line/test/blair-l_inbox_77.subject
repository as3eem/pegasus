There is a problem between PGAS and TMS.
The actual volumes for the 26th are not correct in TMS.
In doing the Bushton PVR report I found that the actual volume in TMS did not match the actual volume in PGAS for the PVR measured.
I then began to look at other points, Spearman, Beaver Co's, etc; and found the same problem existed.
