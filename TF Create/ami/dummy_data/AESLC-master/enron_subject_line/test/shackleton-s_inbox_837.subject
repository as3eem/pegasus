Rene with Daimon Partners at 512-327-6122 has requested that the financial gas contracts with Enron be terminated for April and May.
She wanted to know who she could speak with regarding this issue.
Per our conversation, I have placed a call to her and given her your name as well as Sara Shackleton.
Thanks for your help.
