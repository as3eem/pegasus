For the time being, Ken wants to leave the Management Committee extended meeting on the schedule for this Friday, January 11.
But, he wanted me to check your schedule for next Thursday, January 17 - probably from 8:00 to 1:00 - to see if that would work.
We are losing some people for the 11th.
I appreciate your assistance.
Rosie
