Borderline An Update from Northern Border Pipeline's Customer Services and Gas Control Departments  No: 2001-21                                                    Date: October 26, 2001    Web Site Change  On Monday, October 29, the look and feel of Northern Border Pipeline's informational posting site will officially change.
In addition, the URL tied to the site will be slightly modified.
The new main URL will be www.nbpl.enron.com (nbpl versus nbp).
We recognize that it may take a bit of time for this subtle abbreviation change to sink in.
Consequently, our server has been set up to redirect anyone using the previous informational posting web address to the new site.
But for those more detailed URL addresses that have been set up in a browser or portal site to link directly to information posted in the old site, this changeover will not be as friendly; be aware that those specific addresses will be retired along with the old site.
As for the new web site layout, it has been purposely built under a "simpler is better" philosophy.
It will not win any artistic design awards.
But for the purpose of providing information, we believe that functionality of an informational posting web site should always overrule show.
We hope that you will agree.
It also should be noted that the new site design is not totally new and untested; it closely parallels the solution we implemented earlier this year for Midwestern Gas Transmission, our sister pipeline company.
So those who have accessed information recently on MGT should be familiar with the layout.
As always, we are open to suggestions.
Please let us know what you think.
