PW line has a deficit of about $2.1 million.
We are on day 3.
We might have to fund the account around $2 million if it doesn't cure itself by  tomorrow.
Can we use the Enron line again now that it is paid-off or would  you rather use one of the other lines?
BA has approximately $5.9  million available, which has the most availability of all the lines.
Please advise.
