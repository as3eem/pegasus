Patricia:  I was just checking to see if you have had an opportunity to  review our ISDA Schedule for the referenced entities.
Please let me know if  you have any questions.
I believe that Susan Flynn in our office faxed you a  copy of our form of Schedule last week.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Regards.
Sara
