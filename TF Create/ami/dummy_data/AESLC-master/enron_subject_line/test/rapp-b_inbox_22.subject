For those of you beginning to work with our PSA and Confirm form, the provision  guaranteeing lease payments in the event savings are insufficient is  in the Additional Provisions document in FormsBank styled "Project Savings Deficit Payments".
This provisions may be added to Section 5 of the Confirm if it is part of your deal.
(You will need to convert the language to "plain English.")
I am recommending to the Product team that this be added back into the form itself since all of the marketing materialI've seen references a savings guarantee.
I attach a copy of these Additional Provisions below.
