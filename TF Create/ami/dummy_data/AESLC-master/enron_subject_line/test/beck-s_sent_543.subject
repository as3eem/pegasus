Ted Murphy, Tom Bauer, Jim Brown and I met yesterday to schedule the next  series of operations/controls reviews of Enron offices or certain companies  in which Enron holds an ownership interest.
Attached is a copy of that  schedule.
Please contact Ted or me if you have any questions.
You will note  that the full make-up of the teams is being worked on currently.
We have  identified the lead on each review, however, from RAC, Operations and AA.
