During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.
The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents.
In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI.
Thank you for your cooperation.
