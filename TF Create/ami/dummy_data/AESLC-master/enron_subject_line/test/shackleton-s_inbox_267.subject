Sara,  Thank you for reviewing and returning the equity forward confirmations so promptly.
We have reviewed the handwritten comment on page 8 of the contract and unfortunately cannot accept the language as presented.
Our concern is that if we are unable to get through to Clint for any reason (either speaking to him directly or getting voice mail), the termination notice would not be effective.
We propose to insert the following language instead:

@subject
Equity Forward Contract

@ann0
new language for the contract

@ann1
our proposals for new language on the equity forward confirmations

@ann2
cannot accept equity forward due to language page 8
