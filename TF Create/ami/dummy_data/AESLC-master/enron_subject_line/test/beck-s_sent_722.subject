The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500  employees in the Enron building.
Do you want all of them to choose one of  the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule  one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this  segment of Net Works?
I have noted below the approximate number of employees  per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of  operations employees):      29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol.
mgmt., confirms,  settlements and EIM risk     30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various  products)     31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol.
mgnt.,  settlements and DPR           and MPR teams      32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions),  operational analysis          37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol.
mgmt., settlements, and global  services        Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron  Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would  be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it  easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.
