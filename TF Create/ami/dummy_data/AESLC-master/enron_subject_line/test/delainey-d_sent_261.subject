Jeff, I think we should take a quick review of the existing PI portfolio to  see where we are and where we want to go - we have with the completion of  FCEL made a tremedous amount of investment in a very short period of time  >$60 to $80M.
I would like to  hear how we are moving to monetize more  mature investments and influence/generate value from the earlier stage  investments.
I don't want to approve any further investments until we have  had such a discussion.
