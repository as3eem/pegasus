The Assembly passed the budget late last night.
The Assembly recessed without passing out any energy bill.
There is some talk of a working group being convened beginning next week  comprised of Legislative staff and industry to continue to try to work out a  deal.
For now, however, the free world is safe from the CA Assembly and the  Senate--they've left and all Legislative activity is on hold until the 20th
