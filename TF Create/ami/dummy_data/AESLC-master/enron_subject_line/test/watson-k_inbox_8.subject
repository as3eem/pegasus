Planning has conducted flow studies to determine the capacity of WT-2 system with respect to receiving volume from NNG at Halley interconnect.
The limiting factors in determining the capacity of this system were the maximum discharge pressure at WT-2 and the average pressure requirements at Valero-Ward pipeline.
WT-2 is able to discharge at a maximum of 1040 psig pressure and the operating pressure range of Valero pipeline in this area is 975-995 psig.
Based on the above conditions WT-2 would be able to deliver only 505 mmcf/d gas to :  Lone-Star Warwink	  30 mmcf/d Valero Ward		115 mmcf/d Ovasis			138 mmcf/d Westar-Ward		 80  mmcf/d  Valero Pecos		 95  mmcf/d Lonestar Pecos		 47  mmcf/d Total			505 mmcf/d  This flow model indicates that ( assuming main line valve-208 B is closed) WT-2 would be able to receive up to 100 mmcf/d from NNG at Halley interconnect.
The remaining gas supply behind Wt-2 would flow from NGPL-Winkler, EOG, Keystone/ Sid Richardson, Monument and WT-1.
Based on the data obtained from our TW-Firm Data Book the existing committed volume at WT-2 for next five months are:
