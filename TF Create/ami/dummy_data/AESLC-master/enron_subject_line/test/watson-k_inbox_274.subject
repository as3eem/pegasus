=09Here's what I've found out from Dennis Lee.
USGT requested a realignmen= t of delivery capacity back in June (it was also sent to them in June).
Th= ey held onto the request until a few weeks ago when they signed and returne= d the amendment.
Dennis found where the capacity was disapproved by Perry = Frazier but, for an as yet unknown reason, Michelle Cormier tendered this a= mendment to them.
The changes have been activated in the TW contract syste= m; however, we have not signed/returned the amendment and they have not nom= inated these changes.
Dennis says they switch these DP's frequently and wo= uld "probably" be agreeable to switch 6,000/d of their capacity (which was = suggested by Perry in his denial of capacity) upon our request.
As you're = aware, Michelle has changed jobs since this incident and this amendment was=  tendered prior to our re-implemention of the routing process.
I'll get yo= u the file and associated papers as soon as Dennis has completed his examin= ation.
Our Tariff does stipulate that an amendment, not returned within 30 = days, is null and void.
Since we did not sign and return the amendment, we=  could just say it "timed out"...  just a thought.
