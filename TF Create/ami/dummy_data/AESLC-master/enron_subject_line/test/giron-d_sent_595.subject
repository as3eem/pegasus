Mike,  The reason my mistake was not caught on the benchmark signoff procedure is  that the postid in question did not have a net position.
The procedure  Rahmann showed you is where we check GERMS positions to the position reports  we run using Excel queries.
If a postid has a net position and is not  officialized, it will be caught using this procedure.
It will not, however,  if the postid does not have a position.
I understand the importance of  officializing postid's, as does the entire West desk.
Thanks.
