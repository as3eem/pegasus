This is the 3rd time that I have attempted to get an answer to the following question:  Has or was more than one petition been filed before the bankruptcy court for severance or financial relief for terminated employees.
At the time of the terminations, we were told in a group meeting that the $4500 requested and approved by the judge was the first of several petitions before the bankruptcy judge for severance on behalf of the terminated employees.
To date, we have had no response to indicate what, if any, other petitions are before the court.
An answer to this question will influence our actions on individual claims to the court as well as class action and individual lawsuits.
Would someone within the organization please give us the courtesy of a response via e-mail or FAQ's?
Since primarily lower level employees were affected by the terminations, it would seem that some goodwill and positive PR could be generated by attempting to show that you did not totally desert us in the process of lining your pockets.
===== Sincerely,
