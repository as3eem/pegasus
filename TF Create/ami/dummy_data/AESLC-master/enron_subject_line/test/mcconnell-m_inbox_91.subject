Keep in mind that when you do amendments to move primary points around, the rate must be changed in CBS for the corresponding new paths.
Otherwise, CBS reflects  max rates.
It would also be helpful when a new contract is executed that the rate be put in CBS; otherwise, again CBS reflects max rates.
It is important to get these rates in CBS as the forecasting model pulls all rate information from CBS.
If CBS reflects max rates the revenues will be grossly over estimated.
Thanks for your help!
