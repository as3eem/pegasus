Jason, 	I verbally confirmed the cut that occurred for gas day May 30th with Irene Isais of our Gas Transportation Services department.
Peoples ANR contract 104684 was cut by 6,599 MMBtu throughout the May 30th gas day.
The supply was cut because PGL Gas Supply was not told by Enron North America that the Northern Border supply @ Will County had been reallocated on different contracts.
All four GISB cycles were exercised in an attempt to receive the entire 40,000 but since the contract mismatch was not corrected until the final cycle, Peoples lost 6,599 MMBtu for the day.
Peoples reduced its SIQ purchase from 125,000 to 118,401 for gas day May 30th.
