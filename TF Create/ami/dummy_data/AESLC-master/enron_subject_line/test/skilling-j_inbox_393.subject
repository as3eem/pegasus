Mr. Skilling,  Thank you so much for delivering my resume to your Associate Program recruiting personnel.
I have been in contact with them for the last couple weeks, and recently confirmed an interview date for Wednesday, May 23rd.
I am very excited about the possibility of joining Enron and look forward to a challenging visit next week.
It would be an honor to become a member of your prestigious team.
Again, I greatly appreciate your time and assistance.
You have been a great help.
Have a wonderful week and congratulations on all your continued success!
Sincerely,
