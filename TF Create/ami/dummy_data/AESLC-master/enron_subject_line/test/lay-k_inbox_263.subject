I can only imagine the extreme pressure and stress you are under right now.
I just want to say that we have every confidence in you  and the management team you are forming.
WE will get through this, just as our country will get through the international situation.
Everyone needs a word of encouragement every now and then; I wanted to say we are behind you, respect you and your leadership.
We are trying to do our part in staying focused on our responsibilities, and in some small way contribute to correcting Enron's reversal of fortunes.
Thanks, Ken, for your dedication and inspiration.
