Please look at the "box lunch menu's" at the bottom of this e:mail and let me know if you would like me to order you anything for lunch on Friday, November 9.
The meeting will be ending at 12:00 (noon) and some will be rushing to catch flights and might not have time for lunch.
My original plan was to order box lunches for everyone, but I thought some of you may not be in a rush and have an interest in dining out.
So, please let me know either way what you chose to do.
Thanks!
