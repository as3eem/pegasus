This is the e-mail I mentioned yesterday.
It is not exactly what had been  described to me and I do have concerns with it.
My preference would be to  limit the clause to the providing of letters of credit whenever we ask (as  opposed to any security in form and from a provider satisfactory to us).
I  understand that London legal was doing some tinkering with the language but I  haven't seen anything from them yet.
Let's discuss.
