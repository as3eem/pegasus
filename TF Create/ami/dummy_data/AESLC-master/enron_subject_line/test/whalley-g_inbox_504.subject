Hi Greg,   There are a small number of people in my group who were promissed a completion bonus on the new building.
They were asked to work double time for much of the projcect by Skilling/Bibi and have, in my view, done a remarkable job.
Can you let me know if we will be in a position to honour these bonuses?
They amount to approx $200K in total.
Regards
