Good morning.
I didn't wake Paige up this am.
I told Michael he could wake her up when he  wanted to, which I presume didn't take long.
It feels good to be back.
Last week really wasn't a very good week to take  off, and I was really stressed.
It helps knowing that I have a holiday in two  weeks!
I'm glad, since Michael is off then as well.
Did you make friends with your venison (or was is pork)?
Love,
