This work is scheduled to take place between 7 and 8 am on both days.
Access to customer statements will be interrupted at times on Thursday morning during that hour.
If you access the Bidding and Scheduling pages by directly connecting to an IP address, you should contact your Customer Relations representative for information on how you will be affected.
Otherwise, if you connect to bidpost.nyiso.com, you should not notice any interruption in service.
Please contact Customer Relations if you have any questions.
