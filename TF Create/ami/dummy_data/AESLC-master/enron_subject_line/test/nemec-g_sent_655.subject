Bob,  Attached is the form of Agreement we need to use for ForeRunner.
It is  the same form we used for High Mountain.
We need to make sure it reflects  design and engineering services provided.
We will also need a Tasking  Letter.
Ken Choyce should be able to provide a contract at ForeRunner as  well as scope of work.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.
