Dear Lori,  Just a quick question:  Shayne Newell here (working on the petition) had the company name quoted to her (at a meeting regarding assets in the company) as:  Enron Capital & Trade Resources Investment Corp.  Is there another entity out there with that name rather than Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.?
Thanks!
Jayne
