For those of you I have not told, my brother Eric was recently laid off from Siemens out of Atlanta.
He is looking for a sales position, especially in the field of medical devices.
He is leaving open the option of  moving back to Texas if he is able to find employment here.
I am including a brief paragraph he wrote about his experience.
I would love to have my brother, sister 'n law, little niece, and unborn child back in Texas.
If you know of any contacts in the medical device field, please let me know and my brother will send them his resume.
Jason, my husband, is still looking for a job also!
He is looking for pharmaceutical sales, but is also leaving his options open for other sales opportunities in Dallas!
Thank you for your help during this difficult time!
Hope all is well with everyone!
Chris  From Eric: I am an accomplished sales professional with 10 years experience developing and implementing technology-based solutions.
I have direct sales experience with national accounts and have managed a sales force in the Southeastern region of the U.S.  Over the years, I have had outstanding success building and maintaining relationships with key corporate decision makers and I've established large-volume, high-profit accounts with excellent levels of retention and loyalty.
I've spent my entire career with Moore Products Co., which was recently acquired by Siemens.
Due to the economic conditions and restructuring at Siemens I am leaving the company and I'm seizing this opportunity to apply my high-tech professional sales skills into the medical device industry.
Do you know anyone in this market that could provide me more information about companies in this industry or any companies looking for people with my skills?
