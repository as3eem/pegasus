Sorry everyone!
I've received a virus from someone else and now  your computer may be affected since you're in my address book.
I'm told it  lies dormant for 14 days,  THEN IT KILLS YOUR HARD DRIVE!
NOTE: When I receive this notice, I updated my McAfee and ran a full scan, and it did not catch it.
Here's how to stop it, if you've got it.
Also, send this message to everyone in your  address book.
I received this message, followed the instructions and got rid of it, so please do the same.
The directions for removing it are easy:   1.
Go to 'Start' - then to 'find or search' (depending on your computer).
2.
In the 'search for files or folders' type in sulfnbk.exe - this is the virus.
3.
In the 'look in' make sure you're searching Drive C.   4.
Hit 'search' button (or 'find')   5.
If this file shows up (it's an ugly blackish icon that will have  the  name  'sulfnbk.exe' -     DO NOT OPEN IT.
6.
Right click on the file - go down to delete and left click.
7.
It will ask you if you want to send it to the recycle bin, say yes.
8.
Go to your desktop (where all your icons are) and double click on the recycle bin.
9.
Right click on sulfnbk.exe and delete again - or empty the bin.
If you find it send this e-mail to all in your address book, because that's how it is transferred.
I Apologize!
