Jeff,  At the conclusion of our meeting yesterday you re-iterated your interest in contributing to our efforts regarding the HTC Energy Initiative and in helping develop the forum for the symposium tentatively scheduled for late October.
In response, I wanted to let you know Paul, Lloyd, Joe Avila (McKinsey) and myself will be meeting with Matt Simmons tomorrow, Thur 9/6.
I would like to schedule a follow-up meeting with you to discuss Matt's input and gain further insight from you regarding the event.
Please let me know a time that is convenient for you.
I am open to breakfast and dinner times as well if that works better for you.
Regards,
