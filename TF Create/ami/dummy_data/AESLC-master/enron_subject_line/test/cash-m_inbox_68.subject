Michelle-  I hope that this message finds you well and that you are having a great week.
I spoke with Mark Broadfoot this afternoon and he suggested I try to reach you through e-mail.
I just would like to inquire with you to see if you have any feedback regarding the PWD sample that Darlene Donlan forwarded back to you last week.
If you could please let us know where that stands, or if you have any feedback and/or questions it would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks and have a great evening.
Respectfully,
