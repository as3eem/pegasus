All-  The Curve Validation folder/repository has been setup on the O drive and includes the following folder structure (bold names are those items with subfolders):  O:\Curve Validation	 2001 Reporting Consolidated EES EGM Financial Enron Americas US Gas US Power Canada Gas Canada Power Enron Broadband Services Enron Global Assets Enron Global Markets (excl.
Financial) EGM Financial Enron Industrial Markets Procedures and Template 	(the reporting template, procedures and rollout document are included here)   I've already requested access for you based on the validation team structure, Exhibit A in the procedures mailed last week.
This request should hopefully be done by mid-week.
Going forward if additional personnel in your groups need access to the folders,  please have them fill out an e-request.
The requests will come to me and I will call the RM personnel on each team to clear access rights.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Regards
