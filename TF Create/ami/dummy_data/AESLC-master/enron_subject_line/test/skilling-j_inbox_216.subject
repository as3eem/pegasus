Dear Jeffrey,  I am contacting you at the suggestion of my brother Jeff Spar, Chief Information Officer of Reader's Digest and formerly of McKinsey [NYO 1990- 1999].
I am the CEO of a Houston based Microsoft technology consultancy called ESX Engineering.
ESX has strong capabilities in software development, IT infrastructure and creative services.
We have exceptional capability in Mobile/Wireless and Web based workflow application development.
We also have tremendous domain experience in healthcare solutions.
As a small company CEO I am always looking for new opportunities to meet individuals whose firms may have need of our services.
I would appreciate the opportunity to meet and introduce myself and ESX.
If appropriate we could explore any potential opportunities between your firm and ESX, or perhaps you could provide a further referral.
Sincerely Yours,

@subject
