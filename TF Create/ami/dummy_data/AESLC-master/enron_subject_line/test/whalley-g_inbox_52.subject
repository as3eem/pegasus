I want to remind each of you to attend the Enron Employee Meeting tomorrow at 10 a.m. in the Hyatt Regency Imperial Ballroom.
I hope to introduce many of you at the meeting, so please plan to sit up front.
Seats will be held for you.
This will be a very important meeting.
I look forward to seeing you there.
Regards,
