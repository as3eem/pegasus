John,  Howdy from Houston.
I received a call from a guy named Steve Scott who is  involved with several ventures including a German VC  called eStreet.
Are  you aware of these guys?
They want to talk to someone about e-opportunties  in Europe especially Spain.
I will ask  him to call you once I talk with him  but I don't have your number in London.
Two questions, what is your  phone  number in London (the phone book has you in Germany) and do you know these  guys?
Thanks,
