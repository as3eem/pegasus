Kay,  did you know that the Deerfield option agreements are not held by deerfield (they are held by lauderdale), & that the permits are held by a lauderdale subsidiary?
Bart wants to know if it makes sense to file for deerfield & not for the other LLC's where the project assets are held.
Can you answer this because bart is standing over my shoulder.
K
