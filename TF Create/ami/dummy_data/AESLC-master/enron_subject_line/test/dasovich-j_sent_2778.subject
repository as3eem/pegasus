The Hearings The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like  environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility  witnesses.
The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E  witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices
