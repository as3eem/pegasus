Hi guys, I spoke with the attorney for DRI, a producer on TCO.
He said that he would convince his client not to file a motion in the bankruptcy court for amounts owed for post petition production volumes delivered to ENA,IF ENA sends him a letter by next Friday, 6/28/02, stating definitively that ENA will pay DRI for such volumes and a date certain by which the payment will be made to DRI.
