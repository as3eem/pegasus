There is a pretty large group of us going to the  Firehouse for New Year's eve this year.
Most of the people that attended  the Christmas party and most of the people who went to Schroeder Hall last  year.
Anyway just wanted to spread the word to a few of you who may not  have gotten the word.
Tickets are $25 apiece and probably need to be  purchased before the end of next week.
Roger thinks it will sell out  before Christmas.
Hope everyone has a great day.
Joe if you would  like for us to buy you a ticket let me know.
Thanks
