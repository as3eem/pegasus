All right people, time to quit screwing around and to start planning a little weekend trip up here to Tahoe!
I'm thinking either the 1st or 3rd weekend of March...
I have a friend who's a travel agent and can most likely get everyone a good deal given enough advance notice.
Let me know sometime this week if you're serious about going and what weekend you vote for and I'll get some prices together...  Peace, Chris
