Ray, I am ok with Nick and his group managing if Redmond/Mrha are ok.  Like  Rebox, whoever is technically responsible is highly accountable to ensure  that reporting and procedures are correctly followed and that the project  comes in on time, budget and technically works.
In this capacity, I would  like that engineer to report to you or Wayne Mays.
