I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL  Report to its former glory.
They are making several changes to the report  which seem to result exponentially in glitches.
As of right now the  application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the  absence of any kind of report.
I will keep you informed of our progress.
Thanks for your patience,
