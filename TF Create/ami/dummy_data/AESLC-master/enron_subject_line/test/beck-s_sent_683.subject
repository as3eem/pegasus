Three weeks ago I started a 15 minute meeting in my office on Monday mornings  for a key group working on the commercialization effort of mid and back  office services.
Attendees are my key operations personnel involved, Todd  Busby (for a preview of what's to come), Rahil and Fred Philipson.
The  purpose of the meeting is to review progress on items agreed to for the  previous week and to establish priorities for the current week.
I have been  capturing all of this on the white board in my office to date.
Today I  decided to recap in writing for everyone.
Thought that you might be  interested.
Open the attachment to the e-mail below.
This way you will know  more of the details of our efforts each week.
