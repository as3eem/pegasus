Bothers,     After seeing my first son pledge Phi Sig at Georgia Tech 6 years ago, then my second boy pledge UCLA baseball four years ago, it is with great pride I announce that young Joe Berry  just accepted a bid to become a member of Beta Theta Pi at Auburn University.
He called me tonight with the news and it is just sinking in as I type this.
I figured it would be the last thing he would do, due to his persistent individualism all his life.
It's a really neat feeling to have a son as a Beta.
Very difficult to describe.
Thank God I'm a Beta and I hope to be a better one.
Yours in -kai-,
