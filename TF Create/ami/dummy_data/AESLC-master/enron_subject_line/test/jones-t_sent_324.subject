Mark,  David Portz, Elizabeth Sager and I were looking at this slide and we're not  so sure it's correct.
We think it should reflect two huge power price  spikes, the recent ones of this year, and the big one of last year.
We don't  think the attached slide correctly reflects the two price spikes.
Can you  take a look at it and get back to me...thanks for your help!
