hi everone!
I'm trying to get a feel for who may be interested in a south lake tahoe ski shindig.
I looked into the place we rented 2 (?)
years ago (when cooper flew down from portland via reno on the snowiest day of the year) and it is available as soon as March 8.
Yeah, not that soon (maybe this will give the sky a chance to bear snow).
Between 12 people, 2 nights, a hottub, fireplace, heavenly company, etc.
it would cost about $40/person for the weekend.
Let me know what weekends on/after March 8 would work for you and how many people including yourself may like to come.
let it snow let it snow let it snow!
