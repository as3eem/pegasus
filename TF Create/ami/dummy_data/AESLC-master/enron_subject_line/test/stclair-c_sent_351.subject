Bill and Tanya: Enclosed is a list of "follow-up" items that we came up with based on what we  talked about last Friday.
Maybe some of these can be discussed at our next  group meeting next week so that we are clear on who is handling which issue.
Feel free to send me any thoughts you may have on these issues.
We really  appreciate the enthusiasm that your group has for these seminars and look  forward to doing more of them in the future.
