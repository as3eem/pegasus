calendar.
Also, I would like you to set up a meeting with me, Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney,  Kelly Kimberly, Mark koenig, Rick Causey, and Rick Buy.
I was thinking the  easiest way to get us all together would be to get a room at a restaurant for  6 or 6:30 some evening.
I have contacted Beth and Cindy already, so they  know what it is about, and I will leave messages for the others.
I just need  to check schedules for now.
Also,  I think it would be a good idea to have a get together after work once  a month or so for the Public Affairs organization.
Nothing fancy .

Cadillac Bar or something similar.

Talk it over with a couple of people in the group and let me know  what you come up with.
