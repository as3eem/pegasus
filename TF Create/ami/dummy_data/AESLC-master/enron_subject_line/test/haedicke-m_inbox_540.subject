Mark,  Great news about the deal.
Can I please be provided with copies of the Dynegy documents?
Senior management here, and elsewhere no doubt, have lots of questions about constraints on the business going forward, what could prevent merger taking place etc.
etc.
Is it planned that summaries of key provisions be prepared centrally and circulated?
Thanks.
