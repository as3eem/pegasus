Tracy  Per our conversation earlier this week, EOTT's projection for 2002 Net Income is $26.9 million.
My understanding is that this is all that will be required from us in connection with the 2002 Plan process at Enron.
Please advise if this is not correct..
I'll be out of the office next week.
If anything further is required, during that time, please contact John as soon as possible.
Given the internet problems we've had lately, please acknowledge receipt of this email by sending me a reply.
Thanks Karl
