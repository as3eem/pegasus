Attached is the list for 1/24/00.
For the list dated 1/25/00 which only had one amended counterparty, First  Energy Corp., I have a change in my earlier approval, from the Power Group.
I don't have a code for this, so I'll just tell you, for this Counterparty  Enron call SELL power only to them pursuant to an on-line GTC.
This  Counterparty cannot sell to us via EOL.
