Guys,  Here are the people that have agreed to contribute $25 each for the Playstation 2 that I will go buy for Francesco today:  Federico Pedro Massimo Biliana Vladi & Natasha Claudio Marco Mauro Pietro Farhad  (Eltin and Paul I could not reach but I immagine they'll probably want to come in at the $25 level or some other)  We should convene at some point tonight to sign the card and figure out when to give him the gift   Playstation is $299 +tax and I will charge it on my credit card.
Please reimburse me as soon you can.
Thank You
