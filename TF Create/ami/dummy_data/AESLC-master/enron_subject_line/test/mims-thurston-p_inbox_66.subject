When this email reaches you I pray that you are fine and well.
How was your weekend?
When are you suppose to see the lawyer?
I spoke with mine over the phone on Sat.
and will be seeing the other one on this week.
Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of us.
The lady call me about the apartment, the prospect that was there before I was did not get it.
She offered the apartment to me.
I went in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.
I am soo afraid/scared.
I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I seem evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.
I caught him crying in the basement.
Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive a huge hug.
I love you.
Thanks for being there.
