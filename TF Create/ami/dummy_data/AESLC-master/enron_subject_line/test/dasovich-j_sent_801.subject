Attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel I'll be on at a  CEM conference in SF on Thursday afternoon.
Have distributed to Western GA  team (plus Steffes) for comment and thought you may have some, too.
Topic for panel, "PUC Priorities."
Goal is to (politely?)
refute Loretta  Lynch's and Carl Woods' continued assertions that 1) California's move to  deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2) the  solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation.
The FERC order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat.
Comments are much appreciated.
Best,
