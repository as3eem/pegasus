Clint and I revised all of the LCRA capacity pymts this afternoon, which affected the following deals:  275298	Jan-00			modified option premium 288187		Feb-00			modified option premium 300368	Mar-00			modified option premium 316345		Apr-00			modified option premium 331019		May-00			modified option premium 347153		Jun-00			modified option premium 425790	Dec-00 through Feb-01 modified annuity strips 397802	Mar-01 through Dec-02 modified annuity strips  What steps need to be taken now to make sure these changes get pushed through to your systems?
Does everything prior to the current month need to be auto-scheduled or is it only annuities (not option premiums)?
Thanks!
