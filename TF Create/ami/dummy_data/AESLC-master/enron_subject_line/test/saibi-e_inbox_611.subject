Dear Power Outage Database Customer,  Attached you will find an excel document.
The outages contained within are forced or rescheduled outages.
Your daily delivery will still contain these outages.
In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly.
This will enable you to load the data into your regular database.
Any questions please let me know.
Thanks.
