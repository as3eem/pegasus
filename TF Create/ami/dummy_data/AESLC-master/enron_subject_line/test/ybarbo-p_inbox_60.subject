Dan,  Ref.
is made to yr e-mail today 30th re ETA Oman.
Have just received following from the Superintendent, Nils Reite: ++ Just to give you a brief update on the progressing repair work at the sunny Algeciras roads.
- External assistance team:   * One service engineer from Turbo Technik for the manoeuvre valve   * Two technicians from NorPol Marine Service to assist above   * Three pipe fitters from NorPol Marine Services to assist the Ch.eng.
- All repair work progressing nicely.
As for the ahead steam control valve we   have found an external linkage shaft to be the reason for the problem.
This   is now being extracted and will be polished and refitted.
- We are aiming for completion on 2001-05-01 late evening and sailing on   2001-05-02 early morning.
brgds/NBR ++ This was good news and it seems that we can follow our schedule.
Will revert tomorrow with an update.
Best regards
