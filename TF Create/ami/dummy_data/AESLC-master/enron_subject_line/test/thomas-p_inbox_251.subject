Dear Enron GMAT students,  Due to the current circumstances, we will be moving all of our current Enron GMAT classes from the Enron building to our main office location.
The schedules will remain the same, but your class will now be meeting at 701 North Post Oak Road, Suite #8.
If you have any other questions, please give us a call.
We hope the best for your future.
