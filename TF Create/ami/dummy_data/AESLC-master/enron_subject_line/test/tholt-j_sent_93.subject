I'm comng to town on Sat urday night  Feb 3 (Sat) and  leaving Feb 5th  (mon).
I have to leave San Diego on Monday afternoon to meet with Socal that  night.
I have to come in on the week-end because air-fares are horrible  without  a Saturday night stay and I'd rather stay the week-end in San  Diego.
If you have any time on Sunday or can meet me on Monday  for  breakfast or lunch let me know.
I haven't finalized anything with Larry yet  but I plan on meeting him for breakfast or lunch on Monday but I want to  check with you  first.
