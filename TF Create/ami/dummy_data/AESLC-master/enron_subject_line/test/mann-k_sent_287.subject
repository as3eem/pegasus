Karen,  Fred Mitro forwarded an email you sent him concerning a legal question.
Please be advised that Enron policy requires that all outside legal advice be  coordinated through an inhouse lawyer, and certainly any legal advice given  to Enron employees must be given to Enron counsel as well.
This requires  some discipline on the part of our outside counsel, but we find it works in  everyone's best interest.
Thank you for your attention to this very important policy.
Kay
