Jeff McMahon has proposed that Ben Glisan is the most appropriate person to provide brief summaries to the BoD on Chewco, Whitewing and Marlin, if Ken would like these topics presented to the BoD.
Both Jeff and Ben will be standing by for today's meeting in case they are needed.
Joe Dilg will attend the full meeting, most likely via teleconference.
Following is a revised note to Ken.
Thanks.
