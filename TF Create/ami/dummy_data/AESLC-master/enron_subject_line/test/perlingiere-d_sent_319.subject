FYI, John Grass and  I spoke to Curt Hribernik  this morning regarding  various issues in the Master.
There has been a change in their corporate  structure such that it appears they may  have stronger financial backing or  at the very least a change.
I requested they send documents reflecting  ownership and name change.
Curt  indicated they would be able to provide a  LC.
I told him he and or his credit dept.
would need to discuss these  issues with you before we could continue.
I will send you information when I receive same.
