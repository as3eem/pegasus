Hi All,  Reporting has been migrated to a new (it's own)  database server and  access to the old server has been disabled to ensure the currency of data.
HOW THIS MIGHT AFFECT YOU: If you use tools that link to the Report Settings database, the 'pipeline' DSN on your  PC will need to be updated to point to the new server.
Specifically this applies to  anyone utilizing a Access database to link to the database tables.
RESOLUTION: We will be targeting known users (Justin's Group and Jay) tomorrow.
However if you experience problems as a result of this change please contact me.
Thanks,
