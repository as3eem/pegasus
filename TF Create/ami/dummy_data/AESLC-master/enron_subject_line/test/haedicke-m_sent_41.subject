I spoke to Dr. Emilio Pinto, at the Sao Paulo lawfirm of Tozzini Freire about  joining ISDA.
He and his firm are doing a lot of work for Enron.
He is  familiar with ISDA and said he was interested in joining.
I told him he  would get a call and some materials that he could present to his Executive  Committee.
I reviewed with him the cost of $10,000.
Please give him a call  at 011-551-1-2322100.
I think he could help build membership in ISDA in  Brazil and eventually become a rep office for ISDA in South America.
He goes  by Emilio.
I am working on a lawfirm in Argentina.
Let  me know if you have  any questions.
Regards,
