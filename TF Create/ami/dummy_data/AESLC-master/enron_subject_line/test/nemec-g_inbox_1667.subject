Re:  Dealing with today's uncertain business climate:  How using LRSolutions will help your legal department reduce outside counsel fees, increase legal knowledge and expertise in-house and save countless hours of time for busy in-house attorneys  As you are well aware, legal research and related knowledge activities and products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise.
In-house counsel are frequently asked to provide their companies legal advice in a vast array of legal areas.
With corporate downsizing, understaffed legal departments are usually not equipped to deal with the many complex and varied legal issues that are presented on a daily basis.
Time is precious, as well, and in-house attorneys consistently find themselves hard pressed to attack these difficult legal problems with the degree of care required for thorough research and analysis.

Because associates lack knowledge in the fields that they research, the total number of hours that they spend tend to be excessive.
With soaring associate rates, the ultimate price for corporate counsel often reaches the upper stratosphere.
