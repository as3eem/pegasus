Mark--one of my colleagues, Bob Frank, is going to be attending the hearing on Thursday morning at the Colorado PUC on my behalf.
Bob has as strong background in regulatory proceedings and will be able to expand on our comments before the Commission if given the ability to present.
(As we had talked about previously, it is very possible the the Commissioners will ask interested parties if they would like to speak---this is a tad less formal than evidentiary proceedings).
