The decision to close the Body Shop came after the December 15 payroll run, so you will incur a deduction on your December 15 paycheck.
However, Payroll will refund those charges on your December 31 paycheck.
As a reminder the Body Shop will be open from 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. today through Friday, December 14, to allow members to retrieve personal items from lockers.
Thank you.
