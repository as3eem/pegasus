To whom it may concern:  For January 2, 2002, the in order to pass phase II within the CISO market, I agreed to take a schedule from the DA to the HA in NP15 with the APX.
The schedule is for 17mw on peak.
I built a load zone in PGE3 (ST Cali) and took the trade with the APX to zero.
Please be sure to reempliment the original schedule.
I spoke with Max @ the APX and the schedule was changed because the APX could not verify the schedule with their customer (Sierra Pacific Holdings).
If you have any questions please give me a call.
