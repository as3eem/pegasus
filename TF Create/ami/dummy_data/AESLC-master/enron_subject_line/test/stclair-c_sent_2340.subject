Jay: Jeff Hodge forwarded your voice mail to me.
I will give you a call later  this morning to talk about the LC margin language that you need.
It might  help me if you could describe how the margining will work.
Typically there  is some dollar threshold against  which our Exposure is measured and anything  over that threshold needs to be supported by collateral.
In addition, there  is usually some Material Adverse Change trigger that reduces the threshold to  zero.
Is that how yours will work?
