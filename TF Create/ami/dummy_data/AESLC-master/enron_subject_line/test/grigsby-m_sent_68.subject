Matt, your new responsibility for 7:30 meeting will be to go over all gen  outages in the west by region and fuel type, and to discuss the previous days  gen numbers and load forecasts.
Including pricing info and heat rates from  the Portland guys and/or Megawatt Daily will also help.
Effective on  Thursday.
Thanks,
