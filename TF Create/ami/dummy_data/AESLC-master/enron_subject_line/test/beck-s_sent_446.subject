I asked my new hire to suggest names of people that she knows that would be  good for to consider hiring.
Here is her response.
Tony Vasut had called  her and asked for this list as well.
Do you have him keyed in on our blitz  effort for hiring of risk personnel?
Or is he working on some other  initiative?
I have not reviewed the names nor Shona's comments in detail  yet, but I wanted to pass these along for inclusion in our efforts.
