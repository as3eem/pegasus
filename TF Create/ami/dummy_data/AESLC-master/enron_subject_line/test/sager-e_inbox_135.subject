Please see attached.
While I am not opposed to the formation of the ESIB, I have several concerns based on preliminary indications that the EISB will publish a "standardized" contract for wholesale power transactions.
I'd like to avoid a third or even fourth (if you consider ERCOT still to be a viable option) U.S. based wholesale power agreement.
As it appears that the formation of EISB is going forward, and has FERC endorsement, it might be worthwhile to attend this workshop.
Please let me know your thoughts.
