Thank you for signing up to attend the JDF Kick-off Luncheon and for agreeing  to be a team leader for our campaign this year.
I look forward to seeing each of you at the luncheon tomorrow, Wednesday,  September 6th, at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in the Imperial Ballroom at 11:30  a.m.  Enron has reserved several tables, so be sure to join us at one of our  tables.
Again, my sincerest thanks for your commitment to JDF and our campaign.
