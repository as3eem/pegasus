Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.
Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below).
While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.
When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.
Thank you!
