Attached is the updated scores.
Please check your scores to verify  accuracy.
As the scores stand now, Joey will win no matter what and the  second place race is between Chuck and Wolfe.
If Arizona loses, Wolfe takes  second and if Arizona wins, it goes to the tiebreaker.
The rest of us are  out of it.
If you have 0 all the way out, it means you do not have any teams  remaining.
By the way - nice score Lenhart(we will see if we can get you a  charitable deduction for your $10).
