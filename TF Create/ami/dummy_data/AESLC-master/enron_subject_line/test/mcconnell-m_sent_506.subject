Larry, here is the publication we discussed.
If you have an interest, let  this guy know.
Thanks and welcome aboard.
Wes Colwell is looking for an office.
Right now  there are 2 oppts he is looking at; 1 up here on 33 which is a problem, and 1  office on finance floor.
Do you have a preference, if we have an option?
