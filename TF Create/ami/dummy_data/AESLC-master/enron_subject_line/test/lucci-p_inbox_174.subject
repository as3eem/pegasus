Northern Gas Company is requesting a letter proposal for peaking gas for December 2001 through February 2002.
This proposal could be for the Casper Pooling point #18106 or any other mutually agreeable points into NGC's system.
The volumes should be a max volume of 15,000 to 20,000/d.
NGC would like to receive this proposal by November 7th and we will notify suppliers on November 9th or 12th.
If you have questions let me know.
Thanks, Lorraine
