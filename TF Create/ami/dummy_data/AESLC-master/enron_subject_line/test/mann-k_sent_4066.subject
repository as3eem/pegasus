Hi Rebecca,  I'm trying to locate the sig pages for the NW guaranty.
These were the docs  that I approved after I had approved the letter agreement.
These signed  pages weren't with the letter agreements and change orders you brought me.
To you remember if you brought them to me before?
I haven't really searched  - I thought I would ask first.
Thanks,
