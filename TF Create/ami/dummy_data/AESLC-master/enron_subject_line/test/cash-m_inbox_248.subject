Should we get Greg and ENE OTC to send an email out today saying something like:  In light of all of the recent extraordinary business matters that have been facing us we have held of launching the traditional year end PRC process.
Many of you will recall in our response to the lay it on the line survey we had announced several changes to this process primarily deigned to clarify the purpose of the PRC meetings and streamline the process.
However, given all that has happened in the last 3 weeks and all the critical business matters including the strategic review of our core and non-core businesses, we have concluded that it would be wise not to dictate we follow the previously announced guidelines.
Specifically, we will delegate to each of the business unit leads to decide whether they want to use the 360 PEP electronic feedback process and what form they would like to undertake any relative talent discussions.
Please look for further details and direction on the above from your BU lead in the next few days.
While we hope you understand that we need to make sure that we channel our efforts appropriately at this difficult time, we would want to make sure that everyone understands that: 	1.
We will have a bonus process.
This will be conducted largely as in the past, but with a particular emphasis on those employees		 		critical to business operations and ensuring our ability to successfully complete our proposed merger with Dynegy.
2.
If there is a rationalisation of headcount following our strategic business review of core and non-core, this will be conducted			 appropriately.
Our PRC process will not be the sole determinant in any such process, many other factors will be considered and as such			 this will be a separate process.
Need help with last 2 bullets!
Question is whether to send now or wait for another 3 weeks.
What d'ya think?
