Doug,  Last week, you referenced that there are a lot of deals that come up during  the day for various regions and companies around Enron that your group  doesn't get any monetary recognition for but that they need to be done or are  provided as a service to save money.
By the way, saving money is real money  to Enron.
Would you please provide me with some examples of that so I can  put it in context?
Thanks,
