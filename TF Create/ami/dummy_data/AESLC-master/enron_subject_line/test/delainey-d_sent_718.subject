Hey Crystal hope things are well ....  Dawna is fine.
We have two girls six (Kassandra) and four (Samantha).
We  have been in Houston now three and half years.
It has been a good move from  a career point of view.
Obviously, you had heard my move from Pres./CEO of  Enron North America to Chair/CEO of EES.
I hope life has been as kind to you.
Best of luck in the future.
Regards
