How's it going?
Any thoughts on the AGA number?
We think it is a bunch of BS although all the entries I saw on the Fundamentals Message Board about people selling storage gas give one pause.
HOw are things going on the flying front?
I took my brother-in-law up last night and thankfully managed two good landings.
