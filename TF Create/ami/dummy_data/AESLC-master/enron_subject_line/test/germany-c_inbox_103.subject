Just wanted to see how things were going.
I heard that Vicki had her baby recently!
Is there a way I can contact her while she's on maternity leave?
(or is she checking her work email at home?)
When I talked to you (long time ago) you said you were going to be writing me a novel email.
What happened?
Probably go lost in the mail, huh?
Someone said that Dick Jenkins had moved to another group, is that true?
I guess there have been a lot of changes since I left.
Anyways- I hope all is well and I hope to hear from you soon!
