Sherrie and Rosie:  Jeff and Ken both received notes from Tom Delay about  designating portions of their contributions for use  in Texas.
Mr. DeLay  would like them to make that designation using the letter below (note that it  will need to be modified to be from each individually rather than a joint  letter).
It is, of course, up to Ken and Jeff whether to make the  designation.
