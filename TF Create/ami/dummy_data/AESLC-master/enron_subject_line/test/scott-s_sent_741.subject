Hey,   I know you are monumentally busy this week, but if you get five minutes today  shoot me back an email and let me know if you know any of the Associates  below.
They are all going to be at the dinner tonight so any info that would  boost my B.S.
factor would be much appreciated.
I seem to remember you  mentioning John Massey on a couple of occasions but I have, albeit very  rarely, been known to be wrong.
Hope your day is going well and that you  aren't having to carry Darren too much.
