Steve,  Please find attached the preliminary 2002 EREC earnings and cash flow plans.
This is a preliminary draft only.
As discussed with Tod, the operating cost line has been adjusted at a summary level to achieve the IBIT target agreed to during Friday's review with Stan Horton.
The actual adjustments made to arrive at the final plan will involve different timing and P&L lines.
Please contact me at (661) 823-6467 if you have any concerns.
Thank you.
