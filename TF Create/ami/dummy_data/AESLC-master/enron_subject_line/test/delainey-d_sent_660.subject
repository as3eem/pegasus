Jere, I spoke with Scott on these targets and his belief is that both  himself, Allen and John have significant relationships with these folks which  should help leverage your product into this sector.
Scott and John have  agreed to set up these meetings with the decision makers in these targets  with no delay.
From there, you, John and Scott can determine what deal team  will go speak to them about the opportunities.
I would expect that we will  be in front of these folks ASAP.
Lets see how the product is embraced by  these customers before we extend the target list and create a more formal  alignment of the groups.
As per your earlier e-mail, I assume you are  working on the Reeding & Bates opportunity.
Regards
