Gerald, I am researching several outstanding receivables from Bridgeline.
I am looking for the Schedules to Contribution Agreement, which is item 3 in the index of documents.
Do you know where I might obtain a copy?
Also, is there any type of brief available on these contracts.
I have seen one for ECS, so I was hoping that one might be available for Bridgeline.
Thanks for your help.
