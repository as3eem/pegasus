I'm attaching an article that I just received about the CPUC's and Indicated  Shippers' protests of the recent ENA deal on El Paso.
I have a call in to  Drew Fossum to talk about formulating a formal response, and I will keep you  in that loop in case you get any inquiries.
(My initial, unofficial reaction  is that with the marketing affiliate rules and other safeguards in place, the  fact that ENA and Transwestern have the same parent company should make no  difference to the FERC.)
Until further notice, I would avoid any  communication with ENA on these issues.
If you have any questions, please  e-mail or call me (x30596).
