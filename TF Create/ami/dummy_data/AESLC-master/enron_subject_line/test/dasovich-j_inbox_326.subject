Hello Jeff,  We're winding down a large project , about two more weeks, and preping to begin another, but we should have a small window of opportunity to get to your project, if you're still interested in having us do the work.
So we need to meet or I need more info from you to get a good idea of exactly what you want.
Please let me know.
Thank you!
