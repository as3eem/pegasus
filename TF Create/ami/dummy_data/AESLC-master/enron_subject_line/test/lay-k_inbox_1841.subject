Dear Mr. Lay, I just want to send you a note to say thank you for all you've done for Enron.
I've been with Enron for 15 years (straight out of college).
I may have been impacted financially with what is currently going on but I certainly don't blame you nor anyone for that matter.
It just is.
Thanks to Enron, I have had a very good job for the last 15 years.
This might be the only company I've known but I do have friends that work at other company and this I know.
Not all companies give employees bonuses, stock options, ESOP, upward mobility, matching retirement funds, cash accounts, competitive salary, challenging work environment, on-site health care, on-site workout place, subsidized cafeteria, matching gift giving, involvement in charitable work and community, and many other good things.
I know that you and Enron have always care for the employees and for the community.
