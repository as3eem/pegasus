We plan to complete a teaser letter for bidders and a revised Information Memorandum over the next 2-3 days.
Our target is to send the teaser out on Monday with the IM to follow.
Both will contain revised year-end '01 numbers and '02 projections, which I know you wanted to review before they are released.
I will e-mail you the draft teaser as soon as it is available (probably Saturday) - hopefully, we can chat over the weekend, or at the latest, Monday morning.
