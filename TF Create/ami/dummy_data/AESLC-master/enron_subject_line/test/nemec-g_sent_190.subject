Dan,  Attached are clean and redlined version of the purchase and gathering  agreement.
There is no language in these agreement about a right to match  outside of the Reserve Committment Area.
I haven't had a chance to bounce a  separate agreement off of Shonnie yet, but will let you know.
Call me if you  have any questions.
