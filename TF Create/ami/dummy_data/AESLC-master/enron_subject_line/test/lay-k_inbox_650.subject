Thank you for indicating your preferences for personal follow-up calls to The Center's funds solicitation letter.
Unfortunately, Ben Love's health precludes him from making any follow-up calls on this campaign.
Could I ask each of you very busy gentlemen to commit to call 11 folks as follow-up to The Center's funds solicitation letter?
I will compile the list and adjust any duplications and forward it again to each of you.
Please indicate your preferences on this form and return it to me by e-mail or by fax (or please feel free to call).
Thank you for your
