Steve:  I just spoke with Bill Bradford and I understand that Bill and Mark  Tarkington discussed the use of "Specified Entity" and agreed, subject to DB  committee approval, to eliminate the use of Specified Entity in the ENA and  affiliated masters with DB (i.e., "Specified Entity:  none").
Once you have  confirmed this with Mark, please prepare a final blacklined draft for our  review and then execution copies of the ISDA Master Agreement.
In  connection with the final draft, Tana Jones will fax to you minor format  comments.
[She will also fax to you the electronic trading agreements and  password applications for London and U.S. based trading.]
The following ENA affiliates will also need to execute ISDA Master Agreements  with DB:  (1)  ECT Investments, Inc. (Delaware corporation)  (2)  Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (Delaware  corporation)  (3)  EnronCredit.com Limited (U.K. corporation)
