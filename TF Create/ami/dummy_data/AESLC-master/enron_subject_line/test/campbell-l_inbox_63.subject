JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  All ICAP Suppliers submitting GADS Data and/or Equivalent GADS Data should clearly distinguish GADS Data  from Equivalent GADS Data submissions.
Please identify the data as GADS Data or Equivalent GADS Data and do not intermingle the two data forms in any data file.
Attachment K of the NYISO ICAP Manual clearly defines the data requirements for each data type and Attachment J of the NYISO ICAP Manual explains how UCAP (Unforced Capacity) will be calculated using either type of Operating Data.
Call Jim Pratico (x-6249) or John Charlton (x-6047) if there are any questions on this subject.
