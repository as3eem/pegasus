Note:  FYI, we may see less and less information available on federal web sites in the near term.
FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps  Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines.
In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would "no longer make available to the public" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC.
Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission.
FERC staff has been urged to "respond timely to legitimate requests" for such documents.
The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days.
The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution.
Given the anthrax scares on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, a spokeswoman said the Commission also has been instructed to alert security immediately about suspicious envelopes and packages.
