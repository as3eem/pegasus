Hello Vince,  We've now got some slick results on rigorous and replicable avg temp forecasting models for twelve major U.S. cities, with implications for weather derivative demand and supply (although they are not yet written up formally).
Will you be in Phila anytime soon?
I would like to sit down with you for a couple of hours to show you the results and discuss.
Are you still interested in pursuing a joint project?
I am excited about this.
All the best,
