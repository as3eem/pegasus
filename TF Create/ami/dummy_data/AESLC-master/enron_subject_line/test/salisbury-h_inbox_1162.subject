This message is for those of you with laptops.
We have had some problems with laptops being able to dial into the network using the modem since the upgrade to Outlook has taken place.
We believe that the installation of the Palm Pilots that happened at the same time is what has caused these problems.
For those of you with laptops that have not tested the ability to dial into the network using Ipass since the upgrade, please do so.
We have had a couple of people get stuck on the road with non functional modems and I want to try and catch the rest of you before you need the modem.
Please get with one of us in the IT dept to schedule time to help you test and or fix any problems you may have.
Thanks
