Joe, thanks for the message.
It has been my experience that people who have  had experience in our trading, mid market and structuring groups have a  better overall understanding of how Enron (ECT or ENA) looks at value and  manages risk.
Personally, this is the track I took which included a very  solid foundation in accounting, operations, trading, structuring and then  ultimately in origination.
I hope this helps.
Regards
