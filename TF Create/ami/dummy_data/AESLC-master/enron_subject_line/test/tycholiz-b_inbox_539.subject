Barry,  In spite of the news in the media about Enron, I see opportunity.
Since we've communicated last I've been real busy selling my services to major energy traders.
Actually Enron is one of the traders that have my company listed as one of three or four minority businesses that will be involved with supplying the power for contracts.
These contracts start at $100,000,000 and go up.
Barry, I'm going to forge ahead, but I'd still rather have the opportunity to work and learn from the biggest and best.
