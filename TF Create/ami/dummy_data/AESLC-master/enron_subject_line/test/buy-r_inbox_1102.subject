As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.
This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.
Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.
After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.
Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.
We have a great program planned for this year's conference.
I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.
I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.
As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.
I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.
Regards,
