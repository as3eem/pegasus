AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.
The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following  Sales Price  $5.4850 Transport to Stoi $.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident) Storge Injection  $.0249 Capacity Demand $.0400  Total Price  $5.7025  We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct  31.
Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to  hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).
Thanks
