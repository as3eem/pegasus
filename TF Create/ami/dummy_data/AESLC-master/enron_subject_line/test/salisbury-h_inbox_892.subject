Dear ST_SW Traders,  FYI -  There was a cut on deal # 622350.1 on June 2, 2001 for HE 11.
It was a real time cut that reduced the schedule from 40 MW to 25 MW.
Mirant is at fault for the cut.
(our up-stream is PAC).
We originally thought that this got booked out between Mirant and WAPA, but when I spoke with Kathy yesterday, she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule.
(the people involved during the cut were Geir at EPMI, Bob at PAC, Emily at Mirant, and Jackie for WAPA (Jackie is a control area dispatcher, so she cannot do bookouts for WAPA, hence there was no bookout)).
We have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now.
They do not plan on charging us LD's (she's checking with her boss to make sure.)
We will just reduce the schedules to 25 for HE 11.
It is up to you if you want to charge LD's to Mirant for the spread.
Just wanted to let you know and get your input.
Virginia
