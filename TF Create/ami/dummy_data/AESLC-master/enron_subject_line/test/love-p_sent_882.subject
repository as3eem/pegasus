Jim, Please adjust the sithe storage account to a price of $0, instead of wacog.
This adjustment should not have to go back any further than 11/99.
The  Pipeline is Union Gas Limited and the storage contract number is 96041510.
Please shout with any questions.
Jennifer, this should eliminate the current  outstanding variances and create a variances for all past months that have  been cleaned up.
The P&L impact of the new variances should be minimal due  to the small volume nature of these transactions in the past.
I believe the  variances will be a gain.
Thanks for you help guys.
