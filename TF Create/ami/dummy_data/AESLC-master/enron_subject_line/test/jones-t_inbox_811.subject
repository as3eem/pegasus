1.
Send forms of agreements to counterparty as a first step to get the process moving forward.
If you do not have a contact at the counterparty call the credit hotline at 31803 and ask for Jay Williams or another credit person who can help you get the contact name and number.
Credit is working diligently to get specific legal entity names to us as well.
2.
At the end of each day send a status update, including specifics of steps taken, to me and Carol St. Clair, cc Louise Kitchen, Bill Bradford and Tanya Rohauer.
Carol and I will summarize for Louise, Bill and Tanya, but copy them in case they are interested in any particular party on an urgent basis.
Management has asked that we contact the counterparties at least each day and keep this moving to closure of each agreement as quickly as possible.
