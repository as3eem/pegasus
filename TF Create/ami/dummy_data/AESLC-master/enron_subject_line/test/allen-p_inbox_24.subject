Phillip,   Could you please do me a favor?
I would like  to read your current title policy to see what it says about easements.
You  should have received a copy during your closing.
I don't know how many  pages it will be but let me know how you want to handle getting a copy  made.
I'll be happy to make the copy, or whatever makes it easy for  you.
Thanks,
