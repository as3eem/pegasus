Tanya:  Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec.,  2000 which requires amendment for tax purposes.
A new  total return equity  swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.
ENA must be  the swap counterparty ("normal course of business") for the legal opinion  which must be issued for the structure.
I would like to send Rabo our ISDA  format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.
I assume we do not want  a CSA but will require an Enron Corp. guaranty.
Do we want cross default and  Credit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?
Do we want to  add/eliminate additional events of default?
The ultimate Schedule will  probably look very different from our standard but we need to urge our format  as much as possible.
Please call me to update.
This update is currently scheduled to close next  Friday.
Thanks.
Sara
