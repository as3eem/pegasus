Gerald,  Please review the attached denial letter for the September 10th portion of the W&T Force Majeure.
I am still waiting on a copy of the confirmation to verify that we used the Enfolio Committed Reserves and what date is on it; however, the customer cited the Enron North America GISB as the governing contract.
How do you want to handle these disparities?
Please advise if you have any concerns.
Thanks,
