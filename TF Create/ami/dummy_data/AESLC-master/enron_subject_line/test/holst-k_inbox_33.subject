Please respond by COB Thursday, Sept. 27th.
Attached for your review and comments is Draft No.4 of the subject comments that we are preparing to file following two technical conferences on El Paso's proposal to allocate defined receipt point rights to the firm shippers on its system as required by FERC.
Two of the discussion areas are still being developed in response to information we received from El Paso this morning, and these will be forwarded for review later, along with any changes resulting from comments.
Thanks.
