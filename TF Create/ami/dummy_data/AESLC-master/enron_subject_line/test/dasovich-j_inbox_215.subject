Good Evening Committee Members:  Just to keep you apprised, we have planned for a special discussion of the second extraordinary legislative session with Dr. Barbara Barkovich and Derek Naten at tomorrow's committee meeting.
As noted before, we are hoping to hear from Kip Lipper in Senator Sher's office at our October 17 Committee Meeting.
We will keep you updated in this regard.
*Please note, our October 3 meeting has been cancelled.
The SVMG Annual Planning Conference will be held this year on October 2 and 3 in Half Moon Bay.
Our Energy Director and Committee Chairs will be participating in this conference.
Thanks.
