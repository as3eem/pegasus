Hi Mum!
Sorry I have not called you back.
I have been out late every nite  and trying just to keep myself in constant motion.
Am on the trading floor  this week and can't really talk b/c too many ears.
But I'll give you a call  this afternoon.
Our little bar examinee is alive and well.
They've changed the schedule so  the exam was over yesterday instead of Fri.  She joined me and my work crowd  last night at La Griglia and we ordered champagne.
So I've already  celebrated appropriately!
What do you think of my Destin idea?
talk to you soon Love,
