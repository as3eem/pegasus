Hi Rob,  We are considering assigning a couple of the LM's to an Enron LLC, then  selling the equity.
I've taken a stab at the assignment & assumption  agreement.
Is this ok?
Has WestLB signed of on this form yet?
This is the same transaction I called you about this am.
Any thoughts on the  notice question?
Thanks,
