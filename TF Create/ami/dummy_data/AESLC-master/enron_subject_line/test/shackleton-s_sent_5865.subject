Tracy:  These guys emailed only names of lawyers, accountants, etc.!
Rawleigh White is the CFO for the tribe.
The "broker" intermediary is Jeff  Fuller with Power Resources Managers (425-451-9123) who told me that the  tribe is an Oregon tribe located in Bend, Oregon.
I will separately send you  Stewart's prior message.
I'll send these guys a draft (without credit).
Thanks.
