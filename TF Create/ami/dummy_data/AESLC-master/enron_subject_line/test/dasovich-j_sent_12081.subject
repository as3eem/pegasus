Having failed to resolve either the budget or the energy issues, the  Legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend, at  a minimum.
In sum, though many claim that the Legislature will "vote for something," it  still doesn't appear that the "something" will include a measure that will  keep Edison out of bankruptcy.
The Senate and Assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to  amending the Governor's original MOU (which is dead).
The ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is  growing.
In the Senate: SB18XX---Bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR Contracts
