Just a quick note in response to several emails regarding this Friday.
YES INDEED, Friday Night WINE BAR at Christopher's will be in full swing this Friday night from 6 until 10 PM.
As always, we will be showcasing 45 wines by the glass and our Chef will be offering 5 special "Plats du Jour".
Our wines by the glass are offered at retail prices ranging from $4 to $15, and our "Plats" range from $10 to $22.50.
No reservations are required, but get here early for the best seating.
Or, come in around 9 PM for later seating.
See y'all there.
