Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are  being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk;  b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are  charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying  financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow  position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that  we are reaching these goals.
Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.
David, Joe and Mark  should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues  but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we  watch the funds flow issues.
