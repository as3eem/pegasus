Hey Team.
I need the following services set up on National Fuel.
IAS  <== we just created k# A02353 ISS  <== I think we already have this set up on k#H02262 FSS  <== Nat Fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet.
Believe me, this all happened really fast.
I just sent some of the paperwork  to legal and I need it back by Monday morning.
