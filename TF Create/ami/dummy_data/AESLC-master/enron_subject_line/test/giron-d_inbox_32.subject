The curve files for Netco will need to be modified before they are used in the new environment.
1)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to ermtp Change the service name on the 5th row to 7525 Change the Network Address on the 5th row to ;239.44.16.1;       2) Then hit the   button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.
