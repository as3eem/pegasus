The completion of the identified scrapable East Desk pipes is in site (pun intended :-)...there are only a few outstanding issues remaining.
The pipes in question are:  -  National Fuel and Gas 	This site does a bit of checking to verify how you get to them...basically, it appears they make sure you come to them from a source they trust.
Attempts to work around this have so far failed, so Tara has placed a call to them directly to try and get a resolution to this problem.
-  TCO 	We have discovered a work-around for the strange Javascript issues of this site, but now have discovered that this alternative way to access the data does not necessarily report as much as the original.
Sabina is looking into this, contacting the pipeline themself for help.
-  CGT 	This is a "sister" pipe of TCO, and thus has the same Javascript issues.
We have also found a way around this, but Eddie is not completely certain the data is the same.
I'm going to work with him this afternoon to see if together we can figure it out.
It may be that CGT has the same problem as TCO (not as much data reported in the alternate method).
And that's it!!
TETCO has been finished today, and Iroquois has been set up as a manual entry pipe.
So, from what we can see, finishing the above 3 pipes finishes off the everything identified thus far for the East Desk.
Now, my only question is ...who's bringing the keg in on Friday?!?
;-)  As always, any questions, just ask.
Thanks,
