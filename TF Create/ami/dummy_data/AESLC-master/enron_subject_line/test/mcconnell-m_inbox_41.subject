Seems my computer conspired against my sending the attachment in my last email, so I have attached another version of the schedule for the remaining weeks of the project.
Ken Jones, our chef du projet, is providing pizza for lunch this Saturday.
We will also have coffee, juice, donuts and fruit again.
Please plan to arrive at 8 AM or after and remember to come to the registration table to sign a release form and buy a tee shirt.
Especially on laity weekend, thank you for your ministry on behalf of St. Paul's.
See you Saturday.
