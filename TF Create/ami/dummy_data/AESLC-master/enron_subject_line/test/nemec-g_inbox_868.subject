John,   I am working with Gerald and Debra on implementing a GISB with Tenn. Gas.
Currently, we have worked out every detail.
Their legal department is reviewing our special provisions and then they are supposed to sign two copies of the agreement and send them to us for final execution.
If you have any questions with respect to this Agreement, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Best Regards,
