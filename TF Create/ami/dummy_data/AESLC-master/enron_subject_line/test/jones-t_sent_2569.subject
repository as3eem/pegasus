For those of you keeping track, Carrizo makes 475 master swap agreements.
Conferring with Team Swap, we have at least 20 masters out or going out for  sigature this week (including the 9 Merit Energy Partner masters).
Unlike  the media in the Presidential Election, I hesitate to call this one an early  win (especially after seeing the Board in Marie's office!
), but I must say,  Team Swap is looking strong.
