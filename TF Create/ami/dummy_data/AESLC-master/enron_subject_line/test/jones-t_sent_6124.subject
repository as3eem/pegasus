Would you like to set up this meeting or would you like me to?
I would like  to get this Koch thing resolved ASAP, so I think the sooner, the better.
From Legal's side, both Mary Cook and I need to be included, I spoke to  Credit and both Walter Guidroz and Tom Moran would like to be included,  probably Joe Hunter from the Confirm Desk as well, and anyone else you're  aware of.
Let me know how you think we should proceed.
