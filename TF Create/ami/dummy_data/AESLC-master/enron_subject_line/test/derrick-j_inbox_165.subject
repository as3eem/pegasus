Jim,  your resignation pertained to your directorship with the Enron Poland entity which was the marketing and origination entity for Poland.
You are still a director for ENS which is the comapny that holds the Polish power plant.
I have confirmed with the other directors that this meeting is in regard to operational and contractual matters and you need not attend.
It would be helpful if you sent an e:mail with your regrets to:    Jacek.Glowacki@enron.com
