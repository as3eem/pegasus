Mr. Lay-  With all that is going on, a quick note to let you know that you still have an employee who is confident something good will prevail and not all may be lost.
Though I have only been with the company for almost 2 years, I personally feel you are doing all you can to salvage what is possible.
Your reputation precedes you and the many years you spent building this company up.
I feel deep down that you wouldn't have done anything to jeapordize your name despite what the media and finance markets read.
Responsibility is to be shared.
Unfortunately, you have been left to do the clean up.
I do believe in my heart of hearts that once Jeff Skilling and Andy Fastow were in the positions they were, greed took over.
Unfortunately, they took advantage of your position and possibly lost sight of dealings going on with the presumption that these men were of the utmost, outstanding character.
Please view this email as simply a boost to your morale and not anything more than to simply advise you of what possibly many employees feel but have yet to convey.
Thanks -
