Click here: Latest News Article - FreeRealTime.com    Jeff,  Knowing that ENE is making market in the paper industry I thought it would be   of interest to you to possibly work a deal with DOMTAR (DTC) who just   announced earnings were cut in half due to energy costs.
Sounds like an   opportunity there.
