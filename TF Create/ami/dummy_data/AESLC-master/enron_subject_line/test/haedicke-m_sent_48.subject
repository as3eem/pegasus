Jim, I am looking for weather data by region for 98 and 99.
I believe that  there was a lot of extreme weather this year and I am looking to support  that.
This is background info to support the arguments for standardized  power contracts,  which are nearly agreed to.
Let me know what there is and  who I should talk to.
Thanks for your help.
Mark
