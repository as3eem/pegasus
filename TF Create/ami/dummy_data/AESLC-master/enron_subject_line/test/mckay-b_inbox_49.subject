One Texas Soldier A large group of Taliban soldiers  are moving down a road when they hear a voice call from behind a sand  dune.
"One Texas  soldier is better than ten Taliban".
The Taliban commander quickly orders  10 of his best men over the dune whereupon a gun-battle breaks out and continues  for a few minutes, then silence.
The voice once again calls out "One  Texan is better than one hundred Taliban".
Furious, the Taliban  commander sends his next best 100 troops over the dune and instantly a huge gun  fight commences.
After 10 minutes of battle, again silence.
The Texan voice calls out again "One  Texan is better than one thousand Taliban".
The enraged Taliban commander  musters 1000 fighters and sends them to the other side of the dune.
Rifle fire,  machine guns, grenades, rockets and cannon fire ring out as a terrible battle is  fought....  Then silence.
Eventually one badly wounded Taliban  fighter crawls back over the dune and with his dying words tells his  commander,  "Don't send any more men...... its a trap.
There's two of  them".
