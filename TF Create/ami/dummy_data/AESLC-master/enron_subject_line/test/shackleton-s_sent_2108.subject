Attached is a first draft of the swap for the Raptor 2 structure.
Please  consider the following questions and I will amend the confirmation  accordingly:  1.
I have bracketed the concept of multiple notices for purposes of multiple  partial terminations and therefore multiple Valuation Dates.
Before we  eliminate this concept, I just want to make certain that everyone is in  agreement as to how this swap will terminate.
[Do we want partial  terminations based upon partial asset sales?]
2.
Assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 100% of the assets, I need  to be sure that the word "sale" is sufficient.
Should we use "financial  close" or some other term of art?
I have concerns that a sale may be  contingent or subject to some waiting period.
