Completed an IT agreement with CIMA Energy, who owns 5000/day production on  the Crawford lateral.
Gas will be transported to both the Willi Wick Farm  Tap in the Texas panhandle area as well as to the West Texas pool.
The  agreement is at 0.065 cents, plus fuel for 14 months beginning Sept 2000.
This new shipper on TW will generate additional revenue (currently shipped  under a Duke FT for 0.02).
