The SuperHotOffers.com Newsletter has moved!!
In an effort to provide our subscribers with the best offers possible  we have decided to move our newsletters to the best possible service we  could find.
There were just too many times we would find ourselves  receiving mail from our subscribers saying that they had not received  their newsletter or were having difficulties unsubscribing.
As our  subscribers are our most valued asset we had to think of you first.
Our transfer has been a smooth one and we look forward to delivering  the valuable offers and savings we always have, but this time without  the hassle!
Now we realize that maybe you may not be interested in receiving our  newsletter any longer.
If that is the case, simply click the below  link and well make sure you are taken off of our list.
Its that easy!Please Remove Me  While we hate to see you go, we also value your perception of us.
One  of the reasons we have moved are the easy unsubscribe options available  with this service.
Our desire is to have the cleanest email newsletter  in the industry and if you no longer want to receive our newsletter we  respect your choice.
Thank you for all of your support and we look forward to bringing you only the best special offers and fantastic values we can in 2002!
Thank You,
