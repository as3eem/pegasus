Per Lotus Notes it appears that the above counterparty was acquired by Duke.
I have sitting in my files the originals of both theirs and our guarantees.
Do we want to keep these in place, mutually cancel them or what?
We sent  execution documents to the counterparty and never heard back and put it on  the inactive status.
