Helaine -  Attached is a first draft of the proposed settlement agreement for the CreditStream product.
I have provided standard provisions in relation to liabilities, waiver and releases.
Where there are blanks, I am waiting for additional information and hope to have that soon.
As to Paragraph 7, I was unable to locate a copy of the Confidentiality Agreement between RMG and EnronCredit.com from Sept., 2000.
Once located, I will probably incorporate the confidentiality terminology into the release/settlement.
I hope to have a copy of this agreement a bit later today.
Please look over the attached and provide any comments or questions you may have.
Hope you had a safe holiday.
Mark
