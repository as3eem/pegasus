Jeff: Has there been any discussion on our side with who the Calculation Agent  would be?
Normally, it is one of the swap counterparties.
Is this a role  that Enron Corp. can and should perform?
With respect to the Agreement, I am  looking at a June 2nd draft and was wondering if anyone has focused on the  language in Section 2, and in particular, Section 2(c)  and Section 7.
