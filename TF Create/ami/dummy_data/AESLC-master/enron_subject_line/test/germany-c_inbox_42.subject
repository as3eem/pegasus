All,  At todays Legal Staff Meeting Sara asked that forward to all members of the EWS/EES Legal Department the Indices or Tables of Contents for the Master Netting Agreements & Payment Netting Agreements, which are housed in notebooks in my office.
Therefore, attached are the following:  1.
MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS FOR ENRON'S DOMESTIC AFFILIATES 2.
NETTING AGREEMENTS FOR ENRON'S DOMESTIC AFFILIATES (Liquids Group) 3.
MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS FOR ENRON CAPITAL & TRADE RESOURCES LIMITED (LONDON OFFICE)  It is my understanding that Enron Power Marketing, Inc. entered into Netting Agreements for payment with various counterparties; however, I do not possess copies of those agreements.
The attachments may be a good indictor of what agreements are out there with respect to netting, however, if you need a hard copy of a particular agreement or agreements, just let me know.
