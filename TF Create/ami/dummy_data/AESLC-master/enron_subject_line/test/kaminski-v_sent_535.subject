Rebecca,  I share some of your concerns regarding Mr. Sud.
He is retired and he chose to contact us rather indirectly (or on the spur of the moment).
I understand  that things are done differently in different cultures but I  did not meet him and could not form my judgment based on personal observations.
However, the information  he gave us seems to be too important not to convey to you and not to act upon.
