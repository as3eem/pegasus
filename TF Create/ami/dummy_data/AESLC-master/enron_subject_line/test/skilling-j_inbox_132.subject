Jeff,  Just a brief note to thank you and your team for meeting with me during your busy trip to Boston last week.
Due to time constraints, we did not get a chance to talk at length about NYUonline, so FYI - I thought I would email you a brief overview of our group.
NYUonline is the "for profit" eLearning subsidiary of New York University, and we are a content and technology eLearning company.
On the content side, we work with the over 20 schools at New York University to bring their content online for the individual school's distance learning programs and then repurpose for our Fortune 1000, Government and other Higher Education customers worldwide.
On the technology side, we developed one of the industry's leading Learning Object Driven, and Scorm conformant (industry standard) Web Based Authoring/Publishing Tool that will be released commercially in May ("iAuthor").
The authoring tool enables Higher Education Institutions, Corporations and Governments to bring their content and knowledge online in the form of "Learning Objects".
The tool has received very strong marks from our colleagues in the higher education space (oxford, Stanford, uc Berkeley, uc Irvine, Princeton, Cornell, London school of economics, etc); as well as the corporate market.
In fact, one of the presentations we were having in Boston was to HBS's new interactive unit, and HBS's executive director - information technology group.
Thank you again for meeting with us, and you have an open invitation to join
