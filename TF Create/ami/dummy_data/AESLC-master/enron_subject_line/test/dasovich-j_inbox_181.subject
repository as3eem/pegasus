Haas students:  We all know that recruiting is going to be a challenge this year and utilizing all available resources will heighten our chances for success.
Haas students bring a wealth of contacts to the program and we in the Career Center want to be sure to tap into it to benefit your fellow classmates.
If you have a contact that you think would be interested in hearing about the ways that a company can connect with Haas students through either formal or informal recruiting events (on-campus presentations and interviews, job fairs, job postings, student club firm nights, etc.
), please send us the person's contact info.
It might be a hiring manager you worked with or for.
It might be someone within the company's human resources department that has not interacted with Haas.
It might be a personal contact that has a small business looking for that one key person.
Regardless, we would appreciate the opportunity to pursue the potential recruiting contact.
Please provide the following if available:  Contact name, company, title, phone number, email address, any additional recruiting-related info (type of position (s)he may be interested in recruiting MBA's for, past Haas/MBA hiring, etc.)
Depending on which industry your contact is in, please email your response to the appropriate account manager as follows:  Rich Wong - technology and entertainment/media - rwong@haas.berkeley.edu Jenny Rowe - consulting, consumer products, healthcare/biotech/medical devices, education, not-for-profit - rowe@haas.berkeley.edu Mark Friedfeld - finance/investment banking, real estate - friedfel@haas.berkeley.edu  On behalf of your Haas schoolmates, thanks for any leads you can provide.
Regards,
