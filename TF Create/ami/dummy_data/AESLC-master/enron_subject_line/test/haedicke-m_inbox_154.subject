Could I ask the two of you to please insure that there is a refreshed view on the legal risks relative to both our and El Paso's litigation on East Coast Power.
If this has already been covered, then I apologize.
I just want to make sure Louise has the best data points for making a decision on my proposal of this morning.
Thanks,
