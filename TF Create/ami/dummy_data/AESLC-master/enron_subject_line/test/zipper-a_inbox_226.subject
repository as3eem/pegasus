Hi Andy,  Thank you for briefly meeting with me on November 15th to discuss the questions we were looking for on the Swaps topic  for Crack Spread, BTU and Spark Spread.
Per our conversation, you stated that you wanted to go away to work on these practice questions for Crack Spread, BTU and Spark Spread.
As you know, we were hoping to receive some of your questions this week.
Do you have any idea when you will be able to send them to us or meet with us to help drive these questions out.
Let me know if you have any questions!
Thanks,
