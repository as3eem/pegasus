Mike,  When you evaluate your curves and scalars for the OG&E area, can you also make sure your Entergy long term curves and scalars are in good shape?
We will probably be using those for some load following possibilities and other long term deals such as heat rate options in the Entergy control area.
I assume the scalars would not be much different for either area, but I wanted to make sure they were both updated.
Thanks.
