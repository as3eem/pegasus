Nearly final docs.
The change they want in the LLC is the addition of a statement indicating  that for tax purposes this is a  single member LLC, or something like that.
The promissory note is felt to be necessary due to the adjustment mechanism  for any change orders.
Has something to do with them getting all the basis.
