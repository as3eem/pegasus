BKranz@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Jim,  Thank you for providing your suggestions for proceeding with the assessment of BME/RT pricing issues assigned to the S&P working group by the BIC Chairperson at the MC last week.
The compilation and review of data that you have proposed would take some time and coordination from staff in several departments including Operations.
Due to the conditions we are experiencing this week, we will be unable to provide this data in time for the next S&P meeting.
Because of this, I would propose that we post this list with the meeting materials for the 20th and that we will provide as much information on our assessment of the issue as we can at this meeting.
Regards,
