Eric, Need your help on this.
Let's get a copy of the grazing lease that  Candy is referring to in the E-mail.
I am not clear on what she means by  having Merl operate the well.
I think she means allow him to graze this area  under the terms of his existing lease, but I am not sure.
Can you get with  Candy on this?
Thanks.
