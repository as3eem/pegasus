Ed: Here is a comparison of our form to Clement's.
We need to use our form as it  ties more closely into the swap agreements that we use.
Legal will dela with  Clement if this is a problem but I suspect that it won't be.
His form, I  suspect, is more suited for credit agreements and the like.
I am alos  attaching our form which we distributed today for both the Enron Guaranty and  the Counterparty Guaranty.
