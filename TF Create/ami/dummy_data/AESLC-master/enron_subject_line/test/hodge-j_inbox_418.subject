As we discussed, Enron North America Corp. (ENA) desires to re-establish its account with Paribas.
The purpose of this account would be to sell no more than 2,500 NYMEX natural gas futures contracts to hedge natural gas storage inventory for the months of February, March and April, 2002.
ENA is willing to post margin or otherwise to meet necessary credit requirements.
