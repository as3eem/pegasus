Ms. Peppers, I am very sorry, but I must once again reschedule the  appointment that you have with Mr. Lay.
He will be out of town the entire  week of September 26.
The first available time to reschedule is October 19, 2000.
Would an  afternoon appointment work for you - about 2:00 p.m.?
I look forward to hearing from you.
Rosalee
