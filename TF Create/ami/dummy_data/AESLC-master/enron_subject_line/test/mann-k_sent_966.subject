Hi Scott,  Here's a revised draft for your review and comment.
I've taken out the  balance of plant warranty because you raised a valid point about them knowing  what BOP entails.
So now it is just a warranty.
I've also been more explicit  about our fee.
I think there's a bit of confusion embedded in the document because of the  uncertainty about who is doing what, but I haven't come up with a simple fix  yet.
