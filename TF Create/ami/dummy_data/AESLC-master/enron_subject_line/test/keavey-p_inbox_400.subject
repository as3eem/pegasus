Dear Peter, Pick Your Playground!
We have the cure for the summertime blues, and we'd like to share it  with you: Get out and play!
Isn't that what summer's all about?
The  kids in your life would agree, and so would the kid inside you.
Now  that you're an adult, you may not get three months of summer vacation.
But on the other hand, the world's your playground.
So go ahead--pick
