Hi Sara:  Happy Birthday.
I had a great time in New Orleans but was unable to hook up with Monty.
Hopefully, I was able to succesfully forward to you my reply to Donna's email about getting together this Thursday.
I can not wait to see you both.
My cell number is 281-435-3672 if our plans need to be changed.
I will be out of town tomorrow and Wednesday, but back Thursday.
You can email me or leave a message at my office or call me on my cell.
Take Care and see you Thursday,  Carson
