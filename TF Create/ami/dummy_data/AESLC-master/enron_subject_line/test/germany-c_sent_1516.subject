I created a purchase from CES (deal 149778) to replace the CPR STORAGE deal.
Victor, please move the daily volumes to deal 149778.
As far as I can tell,  ENA should not be billing CES for their storage gas.
So, we should show a  purchase from CES for the storage gas.
Of course it will get much more  complicated once we resolve all of the retail issues.
