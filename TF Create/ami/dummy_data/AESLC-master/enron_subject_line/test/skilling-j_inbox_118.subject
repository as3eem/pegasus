Dear Jeff,  Just wanted to thank you for affording me the opportunity to travel with you last week.
It was truly educational as well as inspirational to hear you address people at Harvard and NYU.
I believe that just by your presence our University sales effort has been catapulted to the next level.
I will keep you abreast of our successes in sales to various Universities that we are targeting.
Thank you.
