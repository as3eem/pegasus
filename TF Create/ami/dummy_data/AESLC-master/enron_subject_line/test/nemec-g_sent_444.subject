Attached is the assignment and contribution agreement for your review.
I  would like to get your feedback prior to wide circulation.
Note:  We are still working with EE&CC to put a basic construction agreement  in place for assignment to the LLC.
ECS retains payment obligation under the  construction agreement even after assignment into the LLC.
Thanks for your  help.
