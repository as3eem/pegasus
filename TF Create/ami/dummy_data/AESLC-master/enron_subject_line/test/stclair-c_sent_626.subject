Here are my comments to the latest set of swap docs:  1.
In the swap assignment, I think that the definition of Regulated  Subsidiary can be deleted.
2.
In Section 3.4 of the swap assignment, in the new language that was added  at the very end, shouldn't it say after the words "Swap Agreement" "(as it  relates to the Assigned Interest)"?
In other words, if these events as to  Party B happen and it results in either an event of default or termination  event under the swap, shouldn't Party A be entitled to terminate the Swap  Agreement with respect to the portion that is not being assigned?
3.
I'm assuming that the changes to Section 3.5(e) track some current cross  default language that Enron is now using.
4.
In Section 3.8, the word comments should be "consents".
Nora: Per my voice mail message to you, I'm assuming that you are okay with Section  5.6.
