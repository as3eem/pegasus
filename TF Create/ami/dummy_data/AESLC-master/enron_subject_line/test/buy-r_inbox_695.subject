Attached please find the daily log as of 08/20/01.
Please note that going forward there will be a change in the format and timing of log issuance.
Going forward the action plan and status will no longer be displayed and the log will only be issued once a week as part of the weekly summary distribution.
The daily exceptions will still be maintained, but not distributed.
If anyone wants information for a specific date, please feel free to contact me and I will forward the log as requested.
If you have any comments or concerns, please feel free to call me at ext 54751.
Thank you for time an attention.
