with enron europe reducing headcount it was raised that tony hamilton should be reassigned to egm.
I'm not sure who should be his manager but can one of you let Lucy know who that is going to be.
Jeff please comment if you don't want this move to happen.
Tony is the meterologist that was hired for Europe.
