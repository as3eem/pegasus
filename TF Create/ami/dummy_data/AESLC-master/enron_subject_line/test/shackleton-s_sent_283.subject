Help me understand HOW MANY Tozzini memoranda exist which address financial  swaps and derivatives.
I e-mailed Michael about this attachment and I think  his response was that Antonio Felix ADDED comments to the attachment.
I am  not clear.
I am aware of only TWO Tozzini memos :  dated 12/26/97 (physical  trading of energy) and 2/20/98 (local derivatives market).
Let's all start  from the same point.
Thanks.
