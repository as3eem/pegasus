Thank you for joining our walk team for the JDRF Walk to Cure Diabetes.
Sunday is the big day and I wanted to take this opportunity to pass along the walk day information and a few reminders.
Remember that Sunday is the day our time changes - we "fall" back and therefore gain an hour hopefully making it a little easier to arrive for the earlier walk time this year.

?
Tent - Look for the tent with the big E banner (Tent 1) very near the starting line.
