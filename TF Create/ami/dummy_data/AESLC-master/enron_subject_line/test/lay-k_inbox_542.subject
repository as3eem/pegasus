Ken - Michael will be talking with this reporter tomorrow but he'd be grateful if you could make 10 minutes to be our Board Voice for this important interview in the Wall Street Journal.
I know you are only available today at 4:30 p.m. so i am waiting for a response.
Here is the background on the interview.
Let me know if you have any concerns or questions.
Thank you in advance.
