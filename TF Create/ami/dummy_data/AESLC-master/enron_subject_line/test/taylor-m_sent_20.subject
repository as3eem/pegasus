Anita:  I seem to remember that our traders in Singapore did a deal with a PRC  company a while back and it was our conclusion at the time that it was a very  dangerous (perhaps unenforceable) thing to do.
My vague memory is that only  financial institutions could enter into derivatives in the PRC and even then  there was invariably a sovereign immunity risk.
Do you remember this and can  you refresh my recollection?
