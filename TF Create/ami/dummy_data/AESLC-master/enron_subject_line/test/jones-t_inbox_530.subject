Tana,  I was thinking of you today because I just got my issue of Texas Monthly and both of your Houston employers were subjects of stories.
You might be interested.
How have you been?
I really appreciate your putting me up for the weekend.
I would very gladly return the favor if I can.
Which reminds me.
Do you want to come here this summer to see the Vatican exhibit?
The tickets are free, you just need to reserve them.
There is an 800 number for info.
When I find it again I can send it to you.
There is also a website,under the auspices of Texas Tech museum.
That's all for now.
Take care.
Kathy
