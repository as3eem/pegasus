John,   I still have not received written confirmation that the gas being supplied  to the Trust is 100% West Virginia Production.
You have assured me  verbally that such is the case.
However, I am sure that you understand  that it is not the least bit unreasonable to have such a certification in  writing.
I need such a written certification ASAP since  Mountaineer/Allegheny needs proof in order to provide the WV transportation  rate.
Please fax me such a certification today if at all possible.
If that  is not possible,  please send me an email stating that such a certification  will be signed in the next day or two.
I am attaching the memo that I faxed and emailed to you about a week ago  that I thought would facilitate getting the certification ASAP.
Thanks very much and regards,
