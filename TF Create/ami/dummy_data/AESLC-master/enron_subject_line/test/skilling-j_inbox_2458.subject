Dear Shack,      I appreciate your standing up for me.
Dent has always had it in for me ever since we threw his sorry naked ass into the fecal slime of Turtle Creek and then dumped him into the middle of the Gamma Phi house during chapter meeting.
What really chapped him was that most of our pledge class was busy doing the same to Mitch Baddour and Rob Bugh.
The only ones we could spare for Dent were Wilson Jones and Steve Larash.
Even so, I think Steve stayed in the car and let Wilson take care of Dent by himself.
I know Doug Dyer was in my pledge class, you morons.
That allusion was an obscure literary device known as "sarcasm".
If you're still confused,  I have a fraternity brother who is also a best-selling author.
He might be able to explain it better (if he can get the creek shit out of his ears).
