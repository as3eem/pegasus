Jarrod:  Attached is the price correction language.
There is a 60 day true  up with a 30 day notification period after the correction is announced.
Upon  notification by a party, there is a 3 Business Day period for payment.
This  language tracks the ISDA so that our approach in each instance will be  identical.
We will need to add "Calculation Agent" to the confirmation.
Please call if you have any questions.
Sara  P.S.
you should use a paralegal for Annex B purposes and if the omnibus is  for a cross-border transaction
