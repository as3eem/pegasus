My spotted-blond, male dog slipped out through an unattended door.
His name is ponyboy and my tenant estimates it was about 5:00 PM yesterday.
Someone told me that he thought he had seen him get hit by car @ taft.
Searching for him has not turned up any clues.
I will be posting signs today, Please let me know if you have any info.
I truly love that dog.
I adopted him moments before he was to be terminated and he is just the greatest little "crazy" dog I've ever known.
thanx
