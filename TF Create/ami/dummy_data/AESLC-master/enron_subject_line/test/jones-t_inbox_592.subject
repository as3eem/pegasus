Tana, attached is the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement with Dynegy Canada Marketing and Trade, a division of Dynegy Canada Inc. (formerly Novagas Clearinghouse Limited Partnership):  	  It appears that around March 13, 2000, we sent Dynegy Canada Inc. an Amended and Restated Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement to replace the original agreement, but it was never signed up.
The following is the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement with BP Canada Energy Company (formerly Amoco Canada Petroleum Company):   	  I will fax to you the execution pages for each agreement.
Take care, Sharon
