John:  Per our conversation, attached is the copy of the Duke confirm.
The  Duke trader is John Miller (713/260-6541).
I am told by our confirm desk that the faxing of the confirm was attempted on  September 11 and every day thereafter until September 26 when the Duke fax  lines were open.
Upon receipt, John Miller called our confirm desk alleging  that he never did the deal (the EOL "back office user" shows that the trade  WAS done).
Please let me know if you need legal assistance.
Thanks.
Sara
