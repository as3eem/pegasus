Hi, Vince,  This is Slav Fain - Oracle DBA  and I hope you remember me.
We've met at the infosession in Berkley and have talked about Houston, rotation program or other possible openings Enron might have.
Today I've saw an add for the Junior DBA position in Houston and I was wondering  if it might be in your company.
I beleive I told you, that I'm pretty open for different position.
I was doing a lot of development projects in Berkley and enjoyed it.
I've also found DBA work also very challenging and rewarding.
I would be very intersted in joining the rotation program to see different possibilities and aspects of IT department.
I'm opening for relocation and I think with knowledge, experience and my enthusiasm to learn and ability to work under tight timeline - I think I can be a good match for Enron.
Hope to hear from you soon.
Slav
