The EnPower database will be down from 4 PM Friday afternoon (6 PM Houston) to 4 PM Saturday afternoon (6PM Houston).
The reason for this is the NETCO/Estate database and hardware split that is occuring this weekend.
You must re-boot your machines following this shut down to access any EnPower applications.
