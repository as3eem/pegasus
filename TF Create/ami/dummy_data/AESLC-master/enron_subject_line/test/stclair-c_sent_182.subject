FYI.
I spoke with Lisa Mellencamp about Donald yesterday and her contact had  nothing bad to report about him from a work standpoint.
The only negative  comment that she had was on a personal basis as she described him as being a  "flirt" at the firm who on occassion has taken a liking to certain female  employees at the firm.
Apparently, with one particular employee he was quite  a pest.
