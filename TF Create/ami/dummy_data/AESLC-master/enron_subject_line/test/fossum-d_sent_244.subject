Mike, here are two draft sets of talking points covering Stan's initial phone  call with Ted Davis to discuss whether a settlement meeting would be useful  and the subsequent settlement meeting itself.
Please give me any comments  you have and I'll send to Stan or have available to hand to him at our  meeting, which I understand is scheduled for 9 am on Tuesday.
I'll  be  calling in from Arizona.
Note there is at least one issue we ought to think  about a bit more--whether to have Stan imply there may be other goodies
