Greg and Peter  Pamela Hickerson called and wanted to know if I would be interested in  speaking in Calgary in Oct. at seminar her organization is hosting.
Greg I  think you may already be speaking.
Is that right?
Would this be a good  opportunity?
She wants me to speak about US power trading contracts and  on-line trading.
Any thoughts if this is worthwhile?
Thanks for you input.
