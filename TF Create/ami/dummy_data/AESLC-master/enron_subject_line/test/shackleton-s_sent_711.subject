I don't know who's working on this deal, so I'm forwarding docs to you all.
Tax reps look ok to me.
[see Total Return Swap Confirmation - Sec.
3.2;  Schedule - Part 5(l) and requirement that swap counterparty which is Enron  Corp. deliver IRS 'Forms 1001 or 4224].
Please leave me voice mail or  email.
Thanks.
Sara  ps.
