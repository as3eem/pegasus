Nothing from Ben yet.
If I don't hear from him in the next couple of hours,  then I think we should be ready with an extension letter, giving them a  couple of days extra for free.
Ben indicated to  me last week that he would  give them some time once they asked.
MK called with questions on the assignment - nothing serious.
