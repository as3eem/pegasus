Help us with inaugurate our first-time finish tent in Austin (as big as regulations allow due to the space available).
It is there that you will get your finish prize which will add some real value to the pain and suffering of your two-day trek in addition to making you the envy of your neighborhood.
Amy Moore, our Austin volunteer lead, will have been there since Saturday to make sure you get your fill of beer, soft drinks and junk food, which is just what most of us want at that point.
If you're hungrier than that, Hooter's is serving dinner to everyone with a wrist-band.
Reminder:  If you're riding the bus back to Houston, drop your bike first, and then celebrate.
Average time for bike transport to Houston after the drop is 5 hours, and it would be good to get the bike there before you.
THANKS FOR RIDING WITH ENRON !
