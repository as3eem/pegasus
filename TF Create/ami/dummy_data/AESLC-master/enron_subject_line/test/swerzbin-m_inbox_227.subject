The stars have aligned to designate Wednesday, October 24, as the day to have our lunch.
Let's meet at Rock Bottom at 11:45 (or we could get all radical and actually leave together from the floor at 11:40) for the celebration.
We could probably figure out how many Kcalories we all burned by riding during September and dedicate ourselves to replacing them at a single sitting!
See you there.
Great work, team--we took the "total number of trips" category for the Bike Commute Challenge.
