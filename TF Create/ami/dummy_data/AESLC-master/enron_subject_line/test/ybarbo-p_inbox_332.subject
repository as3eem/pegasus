Dan,  When the superheater on stb.
boiler was inspected last night, 4 tubes were found sagged and with visible cracks on.
It looks like the tubes have been overheated.
The tubes had to be cut and plugged, but the first attempt failed as they found some leakage in the welding on the cutted tubes end when the superheater was pressure tested and they had to reweld the tubes end once more.
They are now placing some protection around the tubes end to avoid melting down the ends on the cutted tubes.
The vessel is expecting to have both boiler into service within 2 hrs.
We are not quite sure yet what has caused this cracks, but it looks like the tubes have been overheated, i.e rescriced flow of steam through the pipes.
The boiler will be examinated and closely investigate to establish the cause of the deformation of the tubes.
The tubes will also be sent to a metallurgist to get an anylyis of the material.
To rectifying the superheater the following arrangements have been done:  - Turbo Technik will join vsl in LC with the following personnel:   * One foreman   * One boiler maker   * One TIG welder - N.B.Reite will attend in LC - Boiler tubes, 14 pcs in 3 m lengths and tools/equipment will be forwarded to   Freeport, Bahamas.
- Intend to repair super heater during passage to Algeciras/Suez - One Kongsberg technician will attend in LC for control system adjustment, if   necessary.
This will give the following schedule:  Etd Lake Charles June 10th pm  Eta Freeport June 13th pm  Eta Port Said July 2nd 1800lt   ( abt 13 knots)  Etd Suez July 3rd 1600lt  Eta Qalhat July 9th 0600lt      ( abt 18,5 knots)   Reverting  Best regards
