Over the last few weeks, the bond market has rallied (except for today), despite early indications that May was a relatively solid month for the consumer.
If consumer spending remains strong, the US economy is likely to avoid a recession.
With inflation under control, and the economy hopefully emerging from the slowdown over the next few quarters, it seems that financial assets, and in particular stocks, should perform well going forward.
While there are some sub-sectors of the economy that are in a recession (such as manufacturing and the tech.
sector), they too should start to respond to an improvement in the overall economy.
Longer term, investors have a great opportunity to invest in stocks now.

AD Time:  New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This rule greatly enhances an insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.
