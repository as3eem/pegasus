All:  I have verified with CP that we do not want to stop financial trading between  CP and ENA.
The immediate plan is as follows:  (1)  Immediate new guaranty from Mirant Corporation  (Frank to send draft in  the a.m.)  (2)  Immediate amendment of the existing ISDA Master Agreement to replace  Vastar with Mirant Corporation as the credit support provider (CP to send  draft in the a.m.)  (3)  Immediate execution of a short letter agreement to reflect that all  financial trades done until the effective date of the new guaranty will be  honored by CP and subject to the existing ISDA Master Agreement (I will  prepare)  (4)  Review of the existing agreement to see if CP has issues (which we may  consider).
If anyone has any questions, please let me knowl    Let's all stay in touch throughout the day to get this done.
Thanks.
