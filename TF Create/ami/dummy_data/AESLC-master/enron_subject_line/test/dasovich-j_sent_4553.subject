Nancy Rivera-Brooks of the LA Times just called.
Said she'd heard that Ken  Lay and Governor are in frequent talks discussing the possibility of Enron  buying Edison's transmission system.
I told her that Enron is not in the  market for transmission systems.
Next thing you know, we'll want to buy the  nukes.
Best,
