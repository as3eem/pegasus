Attached is the Gas Purchase Agreement between Enron Compression Services  Company and Enron North America Corp.
This backs the gas deal between ECS  and ECC, LLC.
The pricing and terms are identical.
Note:  In the Kachina deal we used Enron Natural Gas Marketing instead of ENA  for this gas deal.
After discussions with tax and accounting, there were no  objections to using ENA in this deal.
Please review.
