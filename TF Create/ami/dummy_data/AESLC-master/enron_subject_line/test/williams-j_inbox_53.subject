Jason, thanks for that.
It seems ok at the moment.
We are planning to use this for retrieving production trades (around 1000 per day).
Do you know what the cause was?
It would be pretty drastic if this happens in a live environment.
I would like to feel confident that it will be reliable in a production environment.
Regards,
