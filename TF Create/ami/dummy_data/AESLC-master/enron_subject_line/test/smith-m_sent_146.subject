Steve,  Yo, what's up?
I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from the  meteorologists...................
Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.
Are you out of a job yet?
I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here  and take a vacation.
Still thinking of your neck of the woods.
Got to run.
