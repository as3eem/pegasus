INTERVIEW TRAINING  On Wednesday, 11/7/01 at 2:00 PM interview training will be held to prepare you for our Super Saturday recruiting event.
The training will be held in the Mt Hood Conference Room.
Since all of you are participating in the interviews, your attendance will be required at the meeting.
(If you are unable to attend, please talk to either Tim or Chris)  CASE STUDY IDEAS NEEDED!
During the interviews, each of you will have an Interview Profile.
More information about the profiles will be outlined specifically in the meeting.
However, we will need your help creating a Case Study Profile.
The night before the interviews, each student will be given the case study which will be discussed during the interviews.
If you would like your case to be considered, please submit it to me thru email no later than Friday, November 2.
All of the cases will then be reviewed by Tim & Chris and the best one will be used for the Super Saturday Event.
If you have any questions, give me a call.
Thanks!
