Rick,  It was good running into you last week.
I am currently looking for new opportunities.
In the last 18 months, I have been working on eCommerce, specifically B2B exchanges and enterprise portals.
I understand that Enron has several initiatives in this area.
I was hoping you could give me some direction.
Attached is my resume.
