Trina and Alicia: Do you know who is commenting on the Enron reps and warranties mentioned in  the cover memo either from your side or our side?
Also, Mark Evans is  calling me tomorrow at 10 to go over the "New" structure.
Let me know if you  want to be plugged in.
I'm not sure if the swap docs are affected.
