Larry:  I am working with Lou on the Gomez Title V issue.
We are preparing a submittal to the TNRCC to void the Title V permit (Permit No.
O-00754) for the gas processing facilities.
Lou wanted to see if you knew whether the gas processing equipment operated after 1995.
If if didn't operate, did it have the potential to operate?
Was the equipment flanged off, shut down, removed from the site, etc.?
Thanks,
