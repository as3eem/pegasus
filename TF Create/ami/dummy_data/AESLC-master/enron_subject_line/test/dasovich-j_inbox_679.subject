Folks- It is October 19th and we have only received registration for our annual retreat from SIX of you.
A simple plea from us gals.....PLEASE GET YOUR REGISTRATION IN TO US AND MAKE YOUR RESERVATIONS AT VILLAGIO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
The deadline for registration is OCTOBER 31, 2001!!!!!
We have attached a more updated agenda for your review.
We are still working on panelists but we have confirmed CPUC President Loretta Lynch as the keynote speaker for Wednesday night's opening reception.
Lastly, we have attached the registration packet again in case your desk ate it.
Thanks for your continued cooperation.
Give us a call or send us an email with any questions.
