Hi Frank,  Just thought I'd send you an email to give you the details we discussed today.
We bought 51,042 mmbtu from Puget Sound in May 2001 at Kingsgate.
They seem to think that they bought part/most of that gas back from us at Kingsgate.
However, I do not see a deal showing this purchase from Puget.
Can you ck to see if you did in fact sell this gas back to Puget?
The sitara # of the purchase from Puget is 623949.
Let me know if you need anything else from me.
Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
