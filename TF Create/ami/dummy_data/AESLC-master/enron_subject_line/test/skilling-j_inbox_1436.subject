<<Innovation Solution summary.doc>>   Mr. Skilling,  Joannie suggested I email you a note regarding KPMG's tax solutions developed specifically for the executive who is exiting, exercising stock options, monitizing stock, and recognizing gain.
We work in concert with your financial advisors and have forged many relationships with institutions, investors and brokers  to bring cutting edge tax ideas together.
KPMG's Personal Financial Planning is dedicated to developing tax solutions for those interested in deferral, minimization , and mitigation of personal income tax.
The attachment gives a brief description of some of our Innovative Strategies.
As a side note,  I am sure you have know the Lay Family and Sharon and JT have been friends of my parents and my husband and I for years through sailing at the Yacht Club at Lakewood and HYC.
I do hope you consider allowing me and my partners a few minutes of your time, to share our Tax ideas with you.
If so, have Joannie call me at my numbers below.
Best Wishes
