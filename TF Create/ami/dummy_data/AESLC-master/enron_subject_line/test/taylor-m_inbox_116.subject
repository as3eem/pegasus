I have scheduled for each of you to meet with Rob McCrory on October 15, 2001 (except for Mark and Susan who are scheduled to meet with him on Thursday, Oct. 12).
Rob will be visiting us next week during the Legal Conference.
He is from our Sydney, Australia office.
Rob is a lawyer by background who has been a Manager in the Regulatory Department there, but he has spent some time over the past year working with David Minns, our Senior Counsel there, on legal-related matters arising in the Australia market.
Rob has been focusing his "legal" time on master ISDA's and other trading documents involving Enron Australia.
While he is here Rob will also be meeting with Mark Haedicke and Jim Derrick.
He is interviewing to become a Legal Counsel (Attorney) in the Sydney office so he can become an official member of the EWS Legal Department.
Attached is Rob's CV for your information.
Thanks for meeting with Rob.
Regards, Alan
