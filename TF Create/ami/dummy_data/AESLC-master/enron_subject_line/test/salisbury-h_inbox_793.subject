Good Morning,  We have a new Enpower Position Manager ready for DEMO.
The new Position Manager has the capability to build a custom volumetric real-time position based on the data in Enpower.
I think it could replace the Forward Obligations Report, current Real Time Position manager, and the Day Ahead Hourly Position Manager if you guys like it.
I will be conducting the demonstration tomorrow, Thursday, August 9th, in Mount Hood starting at 11:00am.
Please stop by if you can and let me know your thoughts.
Thanks,  David Poston
