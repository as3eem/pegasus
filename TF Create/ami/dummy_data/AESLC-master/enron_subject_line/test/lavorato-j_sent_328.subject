Rick Buy  I'm expecting more details from Bill re.
Perry Gas but I'm quite pissed about  this.
I will deal with my traders when I have the details.
On the Retail  side, I think this is the problem in trying to set up a separate Wholesale  trading group in retail which is clearly happening.
This wouldn't of  happened it they were trading through us.
