Endurance, Encouragement, Hope and Bring Home Good Fruit  I heard these words today in our Homily at church.
They seemed to jump out at me with the current situation we have all been faced with at Enron.
You have endured through a tremendous storm.
Although your colleagues have disappeared leaving you to hold the bag, although you are at the center of intense criticism and accusations from investors, shareholders and employees and although the media has been brutal, you have endured.
Your endurance, I believe, gives us the endurance, the encouragement and the hope that Enron will stabilize and be as strong as it ever was and with a much stronger foundation.
Turmoil serves only to strengthen and bring a community together.
It was true on September 11th and it can be true at Enron.
We have been shaken, but we cannot give up.
With hope anything is possible.
Enron has been my home for 20 years.
I was there when we became Enron.
The last week was extremely difficult for all, "the straw that broke the camels back" for me was when I came in to workout on Friday morning at 5:30 a.m. and the Body Shop was closed.
A note on the front door, "the Body Shop would be shutting down at 7:30 p.m. Thursday evening".
I had been so strong up to this point.
After I found a place to shower, I cried for two hours.
A culmination of events finally broke me.
I had been so optimistic.
I am blessed "for the moment", I still have a job.
I believe I would be blessed even if I didn't have a job.
I have not given up.
As long as we have you and "you can endure", I know we will all make it through this storm.
May God Bless You  Nelda Shealy
