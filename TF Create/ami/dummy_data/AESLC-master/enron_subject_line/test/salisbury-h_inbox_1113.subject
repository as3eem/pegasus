The carpet in our office is scheduled to be professionally cleaned on the evening of Wednesday, June 6.
The Facilities office at World Trade Center is requesting we pick up trash cans, floor mats, boxes, etc., from the floor so they can effectively clean most of the carpets.
Therefore, before you leave work on Wednesday, June 6, PLEASE pick up trash cans, floor mats, boxes, etc., from the floor so the carpet can be cleaned.
Let me know if you have any questions.
