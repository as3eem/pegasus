On the referenced list, Credit shows River Trading Company as an amended  counterparty, but I didn't have them at all so I treated them like a new  counterparty.
On the 8/8/00 List, Braintree is a division, and I would like it to read:   City of Braintree, Massachusetts Electric Light Department.
the name on Spinnaker is wrong, Credit will be correcting it to read  Spinnaker Exploration Company L.L.C.
