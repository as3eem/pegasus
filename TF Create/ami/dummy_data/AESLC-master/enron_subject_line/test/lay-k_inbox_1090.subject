Dear Fam,  Sally informed me today that John Brindle, a former head of Enron security, is now involved and will be handling all airline reservations (through Gordon Bethune at Continental airlines), ground transportation and hotel reservations (Four Seasons or Park Hyatt) for us.
He has suggested that we use "assumed" names for all reservations being made.
John feels strongly that there could be a risk and a small unit will attract less attention and be easier to maneuver,  also it will allow for less media coverage...which is a good thing.
Apparently, he will be giving a detailed report to Rosalee on Friday of this week.
I talked with Ken about it tonight and as much as we would love to have you there for moral support we do not want to do anything that would put you in harm's way or create a media spectacle for him.
So, unfortunately, the prudent thing to do is have you stay in Houston and pray for him in your safe environments.
For your information, our plan is to go up to DC on Thursday, January 31 and back on Tuesday morning, February 5.
Ken gives his testimony at the SEC hearings on Monday morning, February 4, and I am told that it will go on until late in the day.
These hearings are on TV and transcripts can be read on the internet.
I will try and get all of that info to you prior to 2/4.
The following is also from Sally:  "John has asked if the kids would have an interest in meeting with him for 20-30 minutes to hear his suggestions for ways in which to best help the situation, and ideas on keeping their families safe on a daily basis?
I expect this would need to be done during the weekday.
I would also suggest it be held maybe at the ROCC 12th floor conference rm.
or at the Huntingdon and for the kids and spouses only, no children as it would only distract from his limited time.
Then, if anyone feels the need to interact with him on a more detailed basis they could arrange it with him, at their expense.
He did express concerns that due to KLL's high profile, kidnapping is not out of the realm of possibility but he has numerous suggestions for circumventing this."
Let us know your thoughts.
Love, Mom/Linda
