All:  Sheila and I have been trying to coordinate the account(s) to receive  the shares of the above entity.
I can't locate the company on the corporate  database.
My understanding is that CF First Boston will receive the shares  and then transfer to our Morgan account (upon our instructions).
CF First Boston has an Enron Corp. account (pre-1994) and can open a  subaccount for EIplc.
However, two (2) items are required: (1)  a letter of beneficiary ownership (2)  Is EIplc a regulated UK company?
If the answer is no, then it (or the  company reporting for it) must provide a net  asset valuation
