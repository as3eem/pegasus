Sally, The attached file shows the detail of plan headcount for December 31, 1998 through 2001.
The only number that I still have a question about, is for EGM December 2001, the number I have in the file only represents the people moving into Networks from EGM (Brent's group).
I left a message with Tom Myers, to get the correct number.
I have also added the graphs that we discussed, which show increase in headcount along with increase in deal counts.
If you have any questions, let me know.
Thanks,
