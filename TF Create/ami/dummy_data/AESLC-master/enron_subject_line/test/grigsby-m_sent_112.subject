I have asked Bob Badeer to help us research what the utilization rate of gas  fired plants in the west was last year and what, if any, the impact of lower  hydro and even warmer temps would mean to gas consumption in 2001.
We need  to account for any political changes in air pollution credits this year that  may increase gas consumption in 2001.
Let's discuss in the afternoon.
3:30 meeting.
