Shigeki Kawano, who has been the head of our office in Tokyo since it opened in April 2000, has resigned from that position effective December 31.
His immediate plans are not yet determined, but we hope that whatever his next endeavor is he will have an opportunity to remain involved in ISDA activities.
We have enjoyed having him as a colleague and appreciate his efforts on behalf of the Association.
I am sure that each of you join me in wishing him well in the future.
Bob
