the tax issue that we discussed at the rmt meeting has been cleared.
now we need to see if the $250 million is somehow at the rmt level or would be trapped in some way in a rmt filing.
i keep thinking that i will have time to track down with weil and has not happened.
can you track this down and then let the group know.
add stuart to this list.
can you do?
?
