I heard more about Viviana before I left London last week and apparently her  concern she was'nt being properly guided or mentored- despite her apparent  current performance and your  lack of time, I think we do owe her an action  plan at mid-year at the latest and a decent opportunity to redeem herself.
Please let me know how I can be of assistance.
Thanks.
