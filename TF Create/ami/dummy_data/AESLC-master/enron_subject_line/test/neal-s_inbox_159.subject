PIRA's Emissions Marketing Intelligence Service (EMIS) just released its latest report to clients entitled, "Update: The Southern California (NOx) RECLAIM Market."
On May 11 the South Coast Air Quality Management District Board removed power generators, as defined under the program, from the NOx RECLAIM market at least until 2004.
However, their actions to date have left the rest of the RECLAIM participants, such as oil refineries, facing an ongoing, extremely tight market balance.
A second, extensive report analyzing trends and prospects in the SO2 Credit Market will be released shortly.
