It's good to hear from you even though you wrote to the wrong nephew.
How's everything going in the big H.  School is going pretty well, my classes are going pretty well except one that really sucks bad.
Tell everyone I said Hello.
I look forward to seeing everyone at Thanksgiving, I'll relay the message to Brad.
