Dear Ken:   When the timing is right, I would like to visit  with you (and Linda if appropriate) to discuss my idea of writing a scholarly  but lively history of Enron.
My working title is Ambition: The Rise and  Fall of Enron.
Perhaps the "Fall" is premature, but it will be revised  accordingly if a stunning comeback is achieved.
One of the advantages of a  longer book is that the last chapter will be on industry developments a year or  two out to see there things really land with or without Enron.
What I have in mind is a two-year research and  writing project--or longer.
It would develop your history through  Transco and then begin when John Duncan recruited you to Enron.
The  history, unlike the books we are likely to see in the next year,  would fully develop a number of energy, political economy, and corporate  culture themes.
I will, of course, bring in all the recent and  forthcoming events as the climax, but the buildup is what will distinguish  the book.
I anticipate it would be akin to "The Prize," but instead of the  "epic quest for oil, money, and power" the Enron story would be the "epic"  or "fatal" quest to create the world's leading company.
