As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.
This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom.
We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together.
