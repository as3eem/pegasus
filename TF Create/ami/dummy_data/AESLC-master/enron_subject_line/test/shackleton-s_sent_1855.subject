Mark:  (1)  Did you consider my voice mail about updating authorized trader  lists and resolutions (by Samantha or Tana)?
(2)  Have you thought about electronic notice provisions?
Shouldn't  default/termination notices be in writing to the appropriate counsel/Corp.
secretary?
And, can we agree to "electronic notices" at all?
There is no  electronic address for a Documentation Desk or Assistant General Counsel.
I  am seeing this type of provision in electronic trading agreements.
Thanks.
Sara
