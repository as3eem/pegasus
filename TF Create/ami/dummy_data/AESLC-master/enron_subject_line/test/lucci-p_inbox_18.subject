RE:  NOTICE TO CLAY BASIN CAPACITY HOLDERS  Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) is planning to perform Clay Basin inventory verification and deliverability tests beginning April 2, 2002.
These tests will involve a 14-day shut-in of Clay Basin for reservoir gas inventory verification followed immediately by a 2-day field deliverability test.
D  uring the 14-day shut-in, Clay Basin customers will not be able to utilize their storage service.
However, in order to facilitate the 2-day deliverability test, an Operational Flow Order (OFO) will be issued and storage capacity holders will be required to take a pro-rata share of their withdrawal capacity from a total volume of 300,000 dth in a 32-hour period.
Questar will work with storage customers to facilitate transportation of their gas supply during this time period.
Questar is interested in finding ways to minimize the impact of this testing on its shippers.
Please contact your Questar marketing repesentative to discuss the testing process.
