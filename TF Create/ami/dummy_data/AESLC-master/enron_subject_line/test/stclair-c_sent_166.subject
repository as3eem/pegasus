Mark: I asked Tana to talk to you about the Susan Bailey situation so you are aware  of exactly what happened today.
Both Sara and I think that it would be very  helpful if you could communicate to the legal assistants what we talked about  and that is that vacation day requests, doctors appts etc should be  communicated in advance to the whole group and they should make sure that at  the very least that the calendar reflects all vacation days.
However you  decide to do that is fine with us.
Thanks.
