Dear prospect sponsors: In behalf of the Rice MBA students interested in th= e Energy Industry I want to thank you for your interest in the Energy Club = and present to you the club's program for the academic year 2001-2002.
We = have a great number of opportunities and the attached program provides an o= verview of the topics for the academic year 2001-2002.
I would like to tak= e this opportunity to present to you how the club intends to involve and ed= ucate the students' body on the Energy Industry, and I would also like to p= resent the format we will use for this end.
We have three levels that built=  one upon the other.
The first level is a general understanding of the Ene= rgy industry, (see Energy 101 event).
The second level it refers to the op= portunities available for MBAs in the Energy industry, (see rest of the pro= gram), and the third will focus on the opportunities/profiles in demand now= , (no identified yet).
The format is a roundtable presentation in which r= epresentatives from different companies bring they perspective and work exp= erience, relative to the topic of the meeting.
Each roundtable has or will=  have a leader and moderator; the leader is responsible for organizing the = event and it is your reference.
Please contact the person associated to th= e event if you are interested in participating in that specific roundtable.=  If there is no name feel free to e-mail me.
The Energy club heavily depen= ds on your participation and your support will definitely bring value to al= l students in different ways.
You will also attract more talents, help stu= dents to take a better-informed decision with regard to the professional fu= ture, and establish a more intimate relationship, mutually beneficial for s= tudents and companies.
Next step.
This coming Friday we are hosting the En= ergy 101 roundtable.
In this case the leader, Craig Parks, will have in th= e panel students with relevant work experience in the Energy Industry.
Ple= ase see the attached file if interested.
Next week I am going to submit th= e Program to all first and second year students, I aspect to have the list = of the moderators by the end of the next week.
I will promptly notify all = of you.
If you are not interested in receiving further information about th= e Energy Club please e-mail me and I will withdraw your name from the list.=   If you believe in this initiative an admiring comment is welcomed.
I wil= l collect all your feedback and implement them if possible in this same aca= demic year or leave them as guides for the next year.
Thanks in advance for=
