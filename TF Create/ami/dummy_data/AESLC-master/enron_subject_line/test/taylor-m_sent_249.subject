Let me add my thanks for your willingness to sign these things for us.
The  guys in London never think about lining up a signatory in Houston ahead of  time who might actually know something about what they're signing and why  they're signing it.
Any chance you'll be in NY Monday night?
I'm taking a few people to dinner &  you might enjoy it.
