Bonnie and I just got back from vacation to learn that you are leaving Enron.
This has to be a major transition for you and if I can be of help in any way, please call.
I'm sure there will be lot's of "noise" and people talking to you about options, but I hope you will take some time for yourself to slow down and reflect a little --- you still have a lot of life
