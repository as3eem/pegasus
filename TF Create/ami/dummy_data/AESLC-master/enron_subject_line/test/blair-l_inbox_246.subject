Effective November 1, 2001, Northern implemented new posting procedures regarding capacity availability.
These procedures are attached.
Several changes have been implemented.
In summary, the following changes have been incorporated:  The Unsubscribed Capacity Report has been updated to reflect the gas day two (2) days in the future vs fourteen (14) days.
a "new" Short Term Sustainable Capacity (STSC) Report has been posted beginning on the November 1st gas day.
This report is displayed on Northern's website under the Informational Posting; Capacity; Unsubscribed Capacity   a "new" rolling 30 day Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report is posted each morning for day-to-day transactions.
Daily capacity can be posted by point or group but must be identified with an asterisk (*) on the STSC Report at least one business day before being posted on the Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report.
Please take a moment to review these report on the website.
If I have left anyone off this distribution that may be affected or interested in the procedures, please forward on.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding these procedures please let me know.
Thanks MW
