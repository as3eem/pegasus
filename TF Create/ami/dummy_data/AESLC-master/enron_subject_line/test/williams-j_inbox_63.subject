David,  	Bryan referred me to you.
We are supporting the People's Energy website which interfaces with an Oracle db.
It has been functioning properly until recently.
I currently do not have insight to see what the connection string is in production, but when trying to connect to the development database "peoplesdev", using U=peoples_user P=peoples_user, I am receiving the error "ORACLE not available".
Do you know if this database is out, or if the login parameters have changed?
Thanks,
