Guys, I will forward the info as it becomes available.
There appears to be  one project in Texas and one in California which are well down the  development road.
If interested in these projects, which have to meet a  December 2001 COD in order to get the tax credit, I would suggest that we  purchase the development sites and turbines from Enron Wind and keep the  asset, commodity position, tax credit and possible green credits in ENA.
They are Ok with that strategy.
This is an opportuntity that needs to  fleshed out fairly quickly - Ben and Dave can you lead this analysis with  close contact with Doug and Tim on the desk.
We can get together to discuss  if you like.
Regards
