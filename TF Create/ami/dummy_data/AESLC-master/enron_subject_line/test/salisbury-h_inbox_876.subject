PGE has informed us that they have a couple of voice mail cards that are down.
WHAT THIS MEANS:  If a call that is going to voice mail hits one of these cards, the call will continue to ring without ever getting to voice mail.
This is a random event as calls get routed to cards based on availability.
If this happens, the party would have to call back and try again, or get a hold of your admin to leave a written message.
THE FIX:  PGE will have cards here in the morning and will replace them on Saturday.
They are waiting to do this because it will require a system wide outage of voicemail.
The repair is currently scheduled for this Saturday, 10:00 PST and should last no more than 2 hours.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Regards
