Just checking on my customers in the Pa Database and saw that Credit approved this Sabic Americas, Inc. 10/5, but that Status still says Credit Reviewing- just wanted to make sure this one didn't get stuck and moves on through to legal....
Please let me know, as I have a meeting scheduled with this customer on October 17 and would like to be able to show him the system with his permanent ID.
Thanks,
