Cheryl:  Attached are Welch's comments.
As you already know, Jennifer is doing the 2-month deal (but no others until  the ISDA is inked).
We do have to investigate the coop issue under Michigan  law.
Both the swap CP and the parent have the word "cooperative" in their  names.
Please see Lotus Notes.
You should send an immediate email to the  department to see if anyone has used Michigan counsel (I saw a single  reference in the Jurisdictional Database).
We may be able to obtain an  opinion from McDermott or even Welch's inhouse counsel.
