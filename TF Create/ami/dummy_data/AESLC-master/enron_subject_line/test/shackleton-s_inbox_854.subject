Per,  Robert Hunzinger from Owensboro gave me a call this morning to find out the status of his contingent call option with Enron.
I told him that since ENA was one of the bankrupt entities, that it would be highly unlikely that he would get paid if his option were to strike this summer.
His determination period is June 17, 2002-August 30, 2002.
Not sure if you'd like to give Robert a call or not, just wanted to let you know that he had called in regarding his swap.
Sara--I gave Robert you name and numbers in case he wanted to talk to an attorney, or send in a letter terminating the transaction.
