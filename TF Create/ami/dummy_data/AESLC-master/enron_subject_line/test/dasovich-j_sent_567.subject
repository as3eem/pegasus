Bowen called, and unless he has to schedule a call with a judge from Texas at  the same time, we're on for 9:30 AM.
He'll call back if there's a problem.
Also, he confirmed my recollection on the dedicated transport v. AFTS and  also confirmed that we can change any names we want and that this is the best  time to make sure what we file in good ol' CA is consistent with our other  filings.
Best,
