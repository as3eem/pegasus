Expect Patti to contact you about setting aside 15 minutes each Monday to  meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week  regarding the commercialization of our services.
While we will certainly  draw upon the knowledge of  others within Operations, we will consider this  to be the core resource team.
We want to continue to build momentum for this  effort.
Knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day  business, this quick focus each week on the key tasks will keep all of us  informed and in alignment.
Thanks!
