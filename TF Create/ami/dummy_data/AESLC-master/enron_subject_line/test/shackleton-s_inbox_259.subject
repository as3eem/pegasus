Sara -  As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline incorporating the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).
The attached is the last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would suggest that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement since it is the final version.
<<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>  Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at which point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature page) via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the Schedule with your revised Schedule.
Thank you for your patience.
Regards,
