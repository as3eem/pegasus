How about Thursday or Friday, June 1 or 2 for a round of golf?
I'm in HOU  all wk and the end of the wk looks pretty light.
I'd be happy to venture out  west to your Katy/San Antonio nick of the woods if you guys are available.
Hill, are you gonna be in Houston around then?
If so, can you sneak the  clubs past your wife?
Please advise.
DF    PS:  I met with Paul Bieniawski and his new storage group today.
Do you guys  know how he parted terms with the Frogs?
