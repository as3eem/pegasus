At Richard Sanders' request, we ask that you freeze destruction of electronic mail for the following individuals (effective immediately).
This request is made in regard to the Bid/Ask patent litigation.
We should retain their e-mail communications going back as far as possible.
Jay Webb 	Kevin Montagne 	Jarod M. Jenson 	Mark E. Taylor (legal) 	Michael Guadarrama 	Louise Kitchen 	Marcello Romano (London) 	Rennu G. Varghese 	David Forster   We will be sending an additional list of IT persons on Tuesday.
Please let me know what else I need to do to expedite this process.
Thank you for your help.
