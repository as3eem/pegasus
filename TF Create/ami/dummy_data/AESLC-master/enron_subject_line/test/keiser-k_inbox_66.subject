Kam: I had issues.
The Trade Type Distribution by Transactions(57,619) does not equal the total number of transactions by tenor(57,583) or by MTM(57,583) due to duplicates.
For example,  deal # EX2226.1 is listed as a Forward and a Flex Price.
Subsequently, this deal is counted twice under the Trade Type distribution and only once in the tenor and MTM sections.
I made a cell note in the attached spreadsheet - Cell H49 of FormB - that lists all the duplicates.
Let me know what you think and I can wrap this up Monday a.m. Have a good weekend.
Thanks,
