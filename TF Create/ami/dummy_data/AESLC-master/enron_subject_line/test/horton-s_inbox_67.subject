Dear Stan,  Given the current state of affairs here in the D.C. office, I am forwarding my resume for your review.
The lion's share of my legal experience has been with Enron's regulated pipelines, both domestic and overseas.
I appreciate your keeping me in mind should needs or opportunities arise in the pipeline group, whether these be as an employee or on a contract basis.
Thanks for your consideration!
