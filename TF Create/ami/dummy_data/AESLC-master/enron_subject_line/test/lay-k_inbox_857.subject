Your e-mail address was in my address book from a forward I received.
I am starting an Inspirational and Encouragement Mailing list.
We all need some encouragement from time to time so that is why I am starting this new Ministry.
If you would like to be on it or know someone that would, just send an email to me with a SUBSCRIBE heading.
These will be stories and poems to encourage and inspire you in your daily walk with the Lord.
This is completely free and you can unsubscribe at anytime.
There is so much garbage being sent to us these days and I feel its time to start enjoying the email we receive and at least get something out of it like encouragement and inspiration.
I don't want to clutter your E-mail box because I know you have a life and don't want to read mail all day long, so I will send you inspirational and encouraging stories and poems 2 to 3 times a week.
I hope this will bring encouragement to many in this world full of trials and troubles.
I believe we need to spend more time thinking of life in a positive way and not worry about every problem that comes our way and simple stories of encouragement can do alot to help us have a better outlook on life.
All Glory and Honor belongs to the Lord for the things He is doing.
