I'm looking forward to your discussion regarding the "reregulation threat" at  the next meeting.
Below are some of my observations:  While it's premature to say we have an energy crisis, we are witnessing the  triple threat of high summer gasoline prices, spiking electricity prices, and  high natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season (I'll send along some  of the data).
There is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national  political issue:  Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bush's ties to "big oil"  (which includes us by the way, though we produce nary a drop); and  Congressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing  to have a coherent energy policy (though, at least so far, the dominant  characteristic of the administration's policy has been a republicanesque  reliance on the market).
Notwithstanding the issue's potential to become political fodder and its  prominence in the popular press, many Americans seem blissfully ignorant, at  least on the electricity issue.
We did some focus group testing recently in  Southern California -- a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego
