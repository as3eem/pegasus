Hi Evening MBA students,  If you plan to graduate this semester for a December 2001 degree, will you  please come by the Evening MBA office soon (by Tuesday, September 25 at the  latest) and fill out an Application for Candidacy form?
We have your fall transcript to assist you in filling out the form.
Since  we need your original signature, an office visit is best.
Thanks, congratulations, and see you!
