John,  My name is Adrian Clark, I am an executive recruiter in the energy industry.
One of my industry sources gave me your name but was not specific as to what you do for Enron.
My firm, First Call Associates, is currently doing a search for qualified front office personnel to present to our clients.
I would like to know more about your background so I can discuss potential new job opportunities if you are interested.
If the timing is not right for you at this time, I've included my contact information for future reference.
You can find more information about my firm at www.firstcallassociates.com.
We are very familiar with the nuances of the energy trading business and have built relationships with many energy companies in North America enabling us to present qualified employees for their consideration.
Be assured that any information we discuss will be completely confidential.
My apologies for sending this to your email at work but I have not been able to reach you by telephone during business hours.
