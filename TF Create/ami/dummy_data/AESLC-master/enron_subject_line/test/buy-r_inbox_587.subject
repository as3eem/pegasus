Please see attached clean.
The Compare Documents feature won't work (too big or something), but here are the substantive changes:  ?
I reorganized the Executive Summary  ?
As for market risk limit violations and loss notifications, Sr. Mgmt changed so they're no longer going to Skilling for Commodity Group and Business Unit levels, although he still approves those limits.
?
Clarified employee trading requirements ?
We heavily edited the Roles & Responsibilities section to avoid duplication (cut in half ) ?
Also, scrubbed the entire body so it should be in good shape now.
Today, Thursday, we will refine the Glossary and clear any comments from Whalley, Buy, Glisan, etc.. - we should be wrapping up by the end of the day.
Also, AA and PWC should be signing off today.
