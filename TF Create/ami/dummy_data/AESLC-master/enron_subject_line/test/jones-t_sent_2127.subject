Per our conversation, attached is the form of ISDA Agreement, with Enron  guaranty attached to it.
As we discussed, Cadwalader will issue an  enforceability opinion with respect to the Enron Corp. guaranty, so we need  to provide them with an opinion with respect to Enron Corp. general corporate  matters.
Thanks for your help!
