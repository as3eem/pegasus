Jane:  ISDA is planning an energy seminar in Tokyo in mid-May.
We have heard there  may be an energy seminar in March or April in Tokyo.
Have you heard of the  earlier seminar?
We are trying to decide whether it makes sense to go  forward on the May seminar.
Could you look into this and talk to the traders.
Thanks for your help.
Regards,
