0	Thanks. Yeah, that's probably a better one, to discuss it straight away. Um I have a lot of the information there. It might not be very clear. Unless you want to plug it back in to yours. I think the scroll wheel um Yeah, and if we're going for sleek and sexy, I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky? I I've got um pictures well I've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it, and they don't really look great. Yeah, a simple pushbuttons. Hmm. But But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly, it just it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message. So I don't think it would effect our circuit board. Yeah. And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it. 'Cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine, good morning Jo. It might be useful to say like where are you remote. Here I am, Jo. But I think that's maybe as far as that one could go? Yeah, just as a fun way to find it. And it says that I think it said the cost of that isn't too much. Um I think it would be helpful to find it, but I don't think it'd um Yeah, I think so. Mm-hmm. I think I'll just just check what it said. Actually I don't think it really says anything about the cost, but it says that it's already in the coffee machines, so like it's already kind of Um. Oh, that was quick. Um okay, so very brief presentation, um. From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute, none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy. Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there, um but there's some curved cases that you can see, uh a range of sizes uh. All of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons. Does that move it? It just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything. Ah it's alright. Um. There wasn't much more to say about that, just rambling. Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at, one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions. And uh it was quite uh a swish model, where it can control uh four devices, T_V_, cable, satellite, video, D_V_D_, audio. Um so that's a bit of competition there. So I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions. Um the scroll buttons, as you've already mentioned, um there's examples of those, but they don't look as sleek as other models. And there's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great. Um Yeah. Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about, um. There was children's remote, where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels. Um but I don't know if that's really in our field? But that's something that's out there. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Right well that's something that we can be aware of. Um. I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there, and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do, it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function. Yeah. Oh yeah. Different languages might not be compatible. Hmm. Yeah, 'cause I think you program um this one yourself, like to say like whatever you want to your question. Hmm. Maybe unless something else comes up. Um yeah I think um I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it. Hmm um and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote. Yeah. Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design. Um just to avoid ambiguity. So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down, they might both have a V_ on for volume, Um let's think how they did this. I'm just gonna check so I do this right. Um. What did they say? Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this, to have triangular buttons, um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up, and that's the first thing that they see Actually that can't be right, can it? Oh well, no, they might see yeah, they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down, whereas the actual button's pointing up, so the function is to turn the button up. So, be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them, because they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes. Yeah. Um and I think that's all I had to say for that. Um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button? Oh okay. I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped, it might make it more complicated to use. Yeah. Maybe just one button, say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions. Maybe that could be a little apple. And then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine, and it wouldn't confuse the numbers. Hmm. S But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design, um even if the design kind of changes, It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases, as well as buttons. And that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look. Oh right, that fits, doesn't it? Right. And that would fit in with what we want, wouldn't it, for the spongy feel, to have everything rubber. Hmm. Yeah and then you could have Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case, but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that. Hmm. But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme, aren't we? We haven't really seen that yet It might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things. Hmm. Well if it's for young people, um like the phone generation, that sort of thing'd probably go down well, and the market research has been on that side of things, hasn't it? Okay, so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case Did we decide on the rubber case? The spongy feel, or did we think that that might go as a trend? Uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case. There's flat, there's single-curved and there's double-curved. I'm not exactly sure what these things look like. Well it says that I'm not exactly sure. Um I'll show you the remotes that I've got. See how uh Let's just get that bigger. See how uh the one Oh I'm not plugged in, am I? That doesn't help. Shall I just turn it round for time? Hmm. Um it's not very clear up there, but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges, like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there. I'm not exactl I don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly, or? But um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there. Definitely a single, maybe a double. Shall we go for single curve, just to compromise? Yeah. And the rubber push buttons, rubber case. Um and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we, but possibly a sticker. Yeah. Yeah and and the voice recognition, we can use that can't we, just to find it. Without affecting the circuit board. Yeah that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years. Uh what sort of shape do we want? Yeah, so it's not too wacky. Um I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape. If you start getting into kinda aubergines and things, it gets a bit weird. Vote? Shall we vote on it? Anyone got any suggestions? Right. Okay. Ah. Well it could be red. Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can, once we find out um Yeah. Yeah that seems pretty straight forward. 'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain. Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple. Ah just the uh shape of the buttons. Yeah.Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one, are we? Okay. Yeah. Mm. I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires, maybe before we m make a decision. Oh yeah, I suppose so, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Just Just just for the call and find thing. 'Cause it's s it's separate isn't it, it's not part of the Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device, so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching. Cool. Right, um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one that's the one I talked about last time, that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them, what was bad, what they used. And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment. So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends. So So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation. The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional. And second, there should be some technological innovation. And then third and l less important than the other two, there should be an ease of use as well. And apparently, the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme. Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy, which is contrary to last year, apparently. I presume it must have been not not spongy last year. So we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else. And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap. And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority, so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed. And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations. So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg, or the the buttons could be spongy, uh somehow. Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic. And then sort of even wackier than that, we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote, say in the shape of a banana or something like that. Right, so that'll be it. Maybe a banana or courgette or something. How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends, do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget, or or you know, do they not matter that much? Yeah. Maybe yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm not Yeah. I'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's possibly it. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's people say that it's the look, they want the fancy looking thing but I'm Yeah. I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into. I think with the mobiles, it's the, you know it's a communication device, people see you with it all about and i if it Yeah. I think Mm-hmm. Well, it was different last year. The trend was different last year apparently. It was not not spongy feel. But I don't know whether the trend will change. I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys, that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly, whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year, you know. Yeah. Mm. Okay. When you say d when you say double-curved, what what exactly does that mean? Okay. No you're not connected to me anymore. That should come up. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right. That's what I was trying to work out. Shall we Yeah. Okay. Yeah I think that think that's a good idea. Rubber Rubber buttons and case. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Okay. And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit. Or veg. Don't know, maybe just Yeah. That's ru rubber buttons, yeah. Yeah. Reasonably spongy I guess, yeah. Yeah okay. Yeah. Apple? Yeah. Yeah. Apple apple a a qu Quite a big one, as well. A big apple. Uh Could be a red apple, yeah. Either, don't mind. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Looks like it.I think we all have a presentation again, so if we go through those and then um. Shall I go first again? I see this a little more smoothly than the last one. Okay right, let's get started. Um basically the uh for the Um I'll back actually. For the components design, um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before. We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate. Then there is a chip and still the sender. So um yes including the power s supply as well. Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas. Uh first in the power supply, we have the option of just the standard battery, um. There's a dynamo. Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up um. There's a kinetic option, which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around, um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced. Um that's one option, but I think that was gonna cost a little more. And then there's solar cells. Um as a final option. For the buttons, we have um an integrated push button, which is Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction. So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options. Um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button, which I guess is just the same as the standard ones. This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer. Um there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down, which may be for the volume. You could do do that. Um one issue for the buttons is, depending on which material we use, if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case, so we have to take that into consideration. Um moving on to the printed s Um that's on the next I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost, that that related to the actual buttons, but it does affect the printed circuit board. Um which is the next section. Basically for the circuit board which is the middle, it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote. The firm supplies a simple, a regular and an advanced um circuit board. And there's different prices according to each. So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons, that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button. Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition. There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost, but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much. Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board, so there is an extra price in that sense. There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense. Um going to my personal preferences, um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up. And this would avoid batteries running out, having to replace batteries and such like. Um for the buttons, I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel. Um and for the circuit board, again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote. So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition, um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board. And that's it. Um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition, we'd have to probably get an advanced one. I'm guessing. Uh but I don't know, so that is something I'll have to look into. Um that's a that's a decision for all of us. Um. Yeah yeah. We decide. Yeah. Um. Maybe w Um. Yes. Is there Um. We could do, yeah. Um yeah we should. As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel, it didn't The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information. Um. Yeah if if you down um. It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted, but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip, which is in the higher price range. Also the display's for something else which we decided against. Um but that bit And note that the push button just requires a simple chip, so that would keep the price down. 'Kay. So maybe just a simple push button, and that would cut costs on the Did everyone get this on the speech recognition? The um it was basically what we said before, the idea that you record in a set message, and then it picks up that message um and replies to you. So it is basically the concept we discussed before. Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board. I'm guessing it would, but got like the definite information. Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than Um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board. So maybe that would be something separate, yeah. Okay, so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it. Oh that makes sense. Okay. Yeah that makes sense, so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility. Okay. Um. Um yeah I I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries. Um. It's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside. It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up. Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement. So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it. Uh yeah I think did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board, it just affected It was just Oh no th that's what that's what I thought, but maybe maybe it doesn't. Um I think I might have got that wrong. It's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah. 'Kay. 'Kay shall I pass on to you now? I assume it would cost extra, but Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later. If you right click and then go onto a previous slide. Okay, right. Yeah, yeah. On the price, yeah. 'Kay. I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market, maybe not, but Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest? So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step, but maybe I dunno for ours, maybe we should Yeah. So you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition. S s so um Yeah, yeah. It w it would make it quite complicated, where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes yes. So maybe we could have like Yeah. Yeah I I know what you mean. So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves. Possible. Mm. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah we got it down to not too many. Um Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment, or are we gonna t Yeah, maybe we should see yours first. 'Kay. Well I dunno I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment, but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are, maybe I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends. to something which is maybe more universal. We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly. Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about, um. Maybe still with a rubber design we could Um. Oh yeah yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case. Um oh no no no sorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons. That's the way round. If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it. Which makes sense. Um. Yeah. I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual would or not. Yeah. Yes yes. Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside. But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production, whether that would just increase the costs, make it more complicated. Yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside, so where the buttons would stay the same, and the general function of the remote would stay the same, but you could change the the way it looked. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. So it is a possibility, um. Oh okay yes that is Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider. Yeah. Yeah I suppose, where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time. Yeah, less likely to So then th th that would Yeah. it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case, and then have the standard rubber buttons as well. Um. Um. Mayb Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel? But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine. Mm-hmm. Yeah yeah. So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on, if we have to kind of 'Kay, so shall we quickly We'll go for single curve, yeah. Single curve. So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply? The one you move around? Okay. Um Oh we ca Yeah yeah, we'll still have the Are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down? I th I think we can by by not having anything too complicated. Um. Um. And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out. Yeah, it was just 'Kay. We will go for the a a a apples apples. Okay. And then we're gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple? Just like the Just working out what we're gonna do for the next time. Um. Yeah. 'Kay. And j yeah, just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well. Fairly sort of self explanatory. Okay. Is that the end? Okay.Okay. Right. Conceptual design meeting. Right. Okay, so Right well um from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes, but uh it didn't work out too well, so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting, I can quickly give you what we what we had. Uh right, so Wishing I hadn't closed the damn Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device. We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself, that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time. We're gonna have uh effectively two pages, a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted, and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements. And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often, only as and when required. So. So basically what decisions uh have we uh made? Uh have there been any uh changes? Right. Three presentation, yeah. So Yeah, fine. Okay. Mm-hmm. What would be the cost do do we know? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. with the printed circuit boards you were going for the Mm-hmm. But are we going f R right. So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue, so would it not be best to rather than I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were. The other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time. 'Cause at that point then you've got the details up there, so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance. Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue. Does that make sense? Mm-hmm. No the scroll wheel required the regular, so the Hmm. Okay. The display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense. Okay. Down. Right. Okay. So. So we're going for p Okay. So is um Simple push button. Mm-hmm. So if we go for the simple push button, so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we? Or are we going for the regular? Mm-mm. But is there any other I mean okay, that's true for the for for that element, but we have to take all el elements into consideration. And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one, or say the regular one, or the more advanced, then that would have to be the same for all of them. S Right. Mm-hmm. No. Mm-mm. Okay. Simple circuit board. Simple push button. Okay. W w kinetic. You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply. Mm-hmm. And how does it get uh charged up? Okay. Okay. So the speech recognition was Are we going for speech recognition? No? 'Cause that required the advanced I had speech recognition requires advanced req require Oh. So okay. Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple. And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much. Would that be In fact, it wouldn't really cost anymore, would it? And then have to change all change everything at the last minute. Okay. S Sorry? Yeah, I've found that try and get it back. So you were saying the scroll buttons Mm-hmm. Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications. So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever, and then you could have additional features in you know like a You'd have model one, model two and model three, and therefore you can sub-divide your market up. But that's really where your field is. Anyway you could add on for an extra package, but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments. Is that So so what are we deciding to do here? Right. Mm-hmm. Uh the fi Yeah, the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote. Okay. Hmm. So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature. And you were talking Mm. And you were talking about scroll buttons? Okay. b Alright, so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons, was that right? Okay. So not to be focused on. Good in in Flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down. An upside-down V_. So that would show that volume was going up, whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. You could have volume up and volume Volume up, down and Like that. And 'cause the idea was to have limited um it was to have sizable amount of information on it. Limited number of buttons. 'Cause it was sixteen buttons, wasn't it that were Okay. You know yourself. Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons, 'cause you're can mis-direct people. And I would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera, so. ... Okay. Now? Yeah. Stand-by button. No th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people, if you're looking for functionality. But what are they gonna be next Yeah. What are they gonna be next year. But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg, next year's uh I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever. That means you're constantly changing your production schedule, and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else, so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest. Well Ah d d But if Mm-hmm. Well. Yep. Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this Or was the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion? It was, wasn't it? So the Mm-hmm. Rubber buttons require rubber case. Uh so, yeah. The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change? 'Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to basically mint them out 'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating, then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do. Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year, uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like, rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle. You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that, and especially 'cause then you could make it something that Well, you might be limited in space, that yes. Well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine. Hmm. So you're talking there about uh changing changing the casing. Yeah you you could do a colour change, so therefore you would yeah yeah I mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones, was to have some in blue, some in red, some in rather than all in black or, you know, which four do you want, as long as it's black? But uh so Yes oh that's true uh that might no Well not necessarily, because you could have your company uh We're we're meant to be finishing up. You could have your company badge and logo. I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there, it actually has a sort of um stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need, whether it, you know, whether the casing be w any colour, could be any colour, but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense, with a with a logo like that, because it's on a white background, the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing. 'Cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it. And in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top. And in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white, which is the predominant colour of the uh the Windows badge, you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product. So. It's uh in in the house, isn't it, I suppose. So don't change case. Change case colour. And we're sort of saying no to that. Yeah. Sounds reasonable. If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case. Okay. One one thing to cons one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other. Whereas if you do um fancy things with it, you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that. And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product. So but No. Mm yep. Oh right. S so do you wanna go for curves, more curves? We're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so. Okay, curved or double curved? So it's single curved. Yep. Yes. Yep. So we've got spongy feel buttons as well, have we? As well as or w or was that So it's rubber buttons, so it's not really spongy feel buttons, it's just rubber buttons. With a rubber case right? And the standby button is gonna be different. Okay so what what shape are we making the standby button? A apple. Oh oh Sorry? A red apple? Is it? Sorry what was that last thing again there? Right much option on that. I thought you were going for a single curve and Alright. Right, so shape of buttons simple. Okay. So that's that, I guess. We should now go away and get these things sorted out. I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever. Okay, so um.

The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting. The Industrial Designer discussed options for each of the internal components. He showed that the size of the chip was dependent on the type and number of additional features used. The group discussed incorporating speech recognition and other functions to be able to decide on chip size. They decided that using speech recognition for the locator function only would allow them to use a simple chip. The User Interface Designer presented several existing products. She presented a specialized children's remote; the group decided to focus on a basic remote that would appeal to a wide market. She expressed that buttons are often ambiguously shaped and that their remote must have an easy-to-use interface. The Marketing Expert presented trends in the remote control market and the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion. The group discussed ways to incorporate these trends. They decided to make the standby button shaped like an apple, to use a rubber case and buttons, and to use a single-curved shape. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype. 
1	Good afternoon. So Hello. No problem. Okay. That's possible on uh this time of day. Starts at three o'clock. Uh Uh, let me see. Our fourth and last meeting. There he is. Yes. Okay this our last meeting. In this meeting we will discuss our final design. And we will do some evaluation about the, not only the product, but also the project. And then we're going to close the project today as well. So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money. And this uh design, detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design, the usability interface design, and we will do the product evaluation. Um, in order to do that we have this agenda. We'll have the prototype presentation first. Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria. Then we will look at the finance. Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget. Because everything costs money, and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost. So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote. But we will see that later. Then we will do the project uh evaluation, and the closing after that. We've got forty minutes. So we will be finished at half past three. But first um we will do the this is prototype presentation. So, if some yeah if somebody wants step forward. Okay. Okay. Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple. Uh just a few buttons and large buttons. But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons. So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Long time. Yeah. If you put Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary. Okay. Yep. Okay. So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there? Just n normal plain buttons. Yeah. 'Kay. No. No. Yeah. Okay. Yep. Okay. That's nice. Then because we only have thirty minutes left, I will move on to the finance part, which is pretty exciting, to see if it's all possible what we wanna do. And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros. If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly, so just correct me if you see uh something wrong. I counted two batteries. But maybe we can also use one. I don't know if it's possible. It's rechargeable. That's right. Okay. That's two Euros off. We need the advanced chip. So there's not much to uh to save there. Here we have the single curves. Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro. Um, I don't know, but I think the single curved is good for design, and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control. I think we have to keep that. Then we have the case material supplements. It's plastic. It's the cheapest one we need. So that's uh not much to save either. But then the biggest costs are the buttons. So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low. Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end. Um, so if we Let's fir first count the buttons we have now. Because I Sixteen. Nah, that will be even more then. Eighteen Euros. So, seventeen. Okay, including the help? Yeah. Uh seventeen. I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long. That saves us uh one Euro already. 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think? Fifteen buttons. And this is No those are one, I think. Yeah but th it's not stated in this files. So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one, by pressing That's possibility as well. So And it's good for the design as well. So you can make Uh let's see. If you make this Looks a bit like uh a cross. Plus. Min. Uh s yeah channel. Yeah w Yeah th I think they count uh the materials. Yeah on the chip there. Yeah. That's right. That's right. But I think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button. But No but I think Yeah. Maybe it is, but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros. Also the L_C_ display, I think it's, I think it's too expensive for the display we use. I think they uh try t That's right, but what's the big advantage of our remote then? Yeah. No. That's extra. That's extra. That's right. That's an option. Poland. Something. Polish supplier. Don't you think we can, if we can count this as v as one button, and integrate th uh these buttons in three, then we save a lot of money as well. Yeah. That's a point. Yep. No. Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros. We don't have any more budget to develop it. Yeah. So It is. If you leave out the L_C_ display. And if you use less buttons. Say Or you can take the single chip. There it is. But then w Good looking. Yeah. I think it's uh difficult as well, but Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers. Then w Because then we save ten buttons. Then we have five and one. And and see. If we have this one and we've got the advanced W uh, we're getting close. Then you will Or maybe you can um scroll. If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display. Until you've got the right number, then you push it. Alright. It's gotta scroll and push. Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well. Yeah. That's right. So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second, then it g turns to that channel. But it would definitely crop cost, a lot. And we need the battery. And the regular chip is not possible? It has to be advanced? It has to be advanced. Yeah. Okay. And we can save a Euro by a flat design. That's an option we can Then we're almost there. Yeah. So if we Yeah but I think that's That is a big advantage, if we're But Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button? If you push it three times? Yeah. Ah that's not really that No. I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel. If you just make it real simple. Because it saves it saves a lot of money. And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen, which can provide extra information. How to use the scroll wheel. How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles. And it's good for the innovative design as well. If you would erase these. Mm eraser? And we put uh Looks a bit odd maybe. That is Something like that. Then, yeah. We've got the scroll-wheel. One, two, three, four, five buttons, if we erase this one. And these are two buttons then. Yeah. Yeah. That's really a good good idea, I think. And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed. So we make one for the volume, one for the channel. Plus scroll. That's right. So we've got one, two, three. Yeah, we can leave the teletext in if we want. That's m that's better. Y yeah. Mm yeah. Uh yeah, and then you can That's right. So we can decrease this one to four buttons. Yeah. That's no problem. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made, I think. Single curved is really easy to just fill in. And cases come right out of the machine. And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine, than a flat one. I think this is a really easy one. Um, what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design? Freek, what do you think? Yeah. Yep. We have to cut costs. Yeah. Yeah I'm ag Ask for more money. Yeah. Yeah. I am agreeing with the usability. Yeah. Yeah. But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one. Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more. So people will use it more, and especially for the help functions, it will be good if we have scroll bar, scroll button. It will be necessary to have good help function, as well. So this is scroll. I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier. Before we went on to the to the whole design. But I'm glad we could make a bit. It's pretty different, if you saw the last one than this one. Yeah. It will. Yeah. No, but I think I think the most That's right. We can let l We can stick it out, a bit. Like a old old buttons. Maybe that's recognisable for them as well. Yeah. That's a good one. So, I'm afraid we have to move on. And it's uh it's b uh less frightening, I think. If they see this design they think oh, there are only five buttons, and uh But we will see. Yeah. That's definitely right. Yeah. I would buy it. That's right. I would buy it if I was six. No I don't know. What it costs under twelve and a half Euros? No? Uh, yes they are. No. But we can go on with the project evaluation. Let's see. I can sit down I think. We still have fifteen minutes left, so we're nice on schedule. Um, the project process. Evaluation criteria. That's right. That was the the point I forgot. I should There we are. Evaluation criteria. Go ahead. We've got five minutes I think for those criteria. No we've got fifteen minutes but Uh yes. What? Uh yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload his data. I tried to but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software. I think it's fancy. Yeah. Six. Very. Subtitles, buttons. Yeah. Seven. Yeah. So we've got twenty cents for our docking station, huh? Yeah. That's right. That's a bit dodgy. I would say four. Four or five between. Between four or five. Yeah. Is it functional? Yes. No. Think it's uh seven. It was. I had them worked out. Mm. They are ugly, not very functional, and getting lost. Yeah. No I think with our new radio button, I think it's uh I think it's better. I think it Yeah. I would give it a four. Then we have to do the three. It's the Yes it is. Yeah. And they wanna put fashion in their products. Uh in the slogan of the company. And we have the removable front cases. So, I think it's very recognisable. Yep. We've got a calculate it. Mm? N We've gonna We're going to evaluate it. Forty nine. Forty one. That's Around eighty percent. What is it? That's eighty four percent. I think that's a pretty nice score. Okay. Thank you. So, that brings us to the project evaluation. Yep. Thank you. Project process. Did we move through the right phases, you think? Along the process? That's right. So lack of information about prices. Okay. Uh Okay. Satisfaction. Was there room for creativity? No? It's because of the finance sheet. Yeah. The room was Yeah. Restrictions. Internet access. 'Kay. Leadership. Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions? Yeah? Teamwork? Did it work out? Working together? Also, you two of you with the uh last phase? Nice. tasks. Okay. Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do? Or were they too much? Smart-board. If it wants to download its uh data. Failed download. Smart-board was irritating. So you rather wanted to have a flip-over? Or something else? Faster as well, I think. Yeah. Flip-over. Yeah. Uh you need a smart board uh application I think. But I think you can Yeah. Should be possible. Yeah you can export it as image. Must Yeah must be So the sharing of the information was uh was okay? Uh, network. Yeah, pen is here on the table. Yeah. It's possible. Okay. That's nice. Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings? Or Yeah. Yeah. So Yeah. So everybody puts his own score. And then it mediates the score, and you can get one Yeah. That's better. So that's uh How do we call? Evaluation criteria. Okay. Mm, any more ideas? Or questions about the project? Or about the product? Because I think then that we get to our last sheet. Are the costs within the budget? Yeah. Do we Docking station. That's a good point. But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher? Uh and I think you can compensate that as well. So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem, because it's very cheap to make as well. Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million? Or what was it? Fifteen fifteen million. I think we will. If we gonna export this product. It's innovative. Especially in America. People are pretty decadent. Sometimes. You can do more. Yeah. Just put it on the market for everybody. You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers. That's one thing you can change it with. So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market. Just as a test. See how it works. That's I think a good advantage. Yeah. Uh, uh then I think we can have our little celebration, right now. That's it. Yeah. I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire. I think. I don't know. I didn't get a message from the from ending of the Oh I think I have one now. Five more minutes? Oh that's nice. Then we still have some questions. If somebody has some questions they can ask them now. Or we can put these in the project folder as well. Maybe that's Export as picture, I think. Hmm. This is another network, I guess. Does somebody see the project folder? I don't. Hmm. My Documents. Yeah, I'll just put it in My Documents and uh That's okay. Okay. I think I'm going to make our final presentation now. And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation. Summary of the project. Yeah. Questionnaire. I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room. And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes, or something. Okay. Thank you. Hopefully my pen will download its software. Oh. Or data.So Yeah. Yeah. Uh, that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh So um You put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred. Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons. And you But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel. S so uh the shifting uh button. Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext, and shifting uh down. So Oh yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Uh, or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh Yeah. But m Yeah. We disc discuss that already. But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option. So uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh And uh Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it Yeah yeah. Just to recognise it, so uh Uh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um Y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also, but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it. Uh so Nay. Mm. Yeah we can u just uh 'Kay. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh Sixteen, I believe so. Uh seventeen. Uh with the help button. Yeah.. Yeah. Where did uh Uh, it's just one button. But, um Yeah. There were uh two uh for one big button. But they are uh more expensive than the small ones. Uh, yeah. So It's just a. But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper. So uh, we've still got four buttons, but just um So You got uh not not a butt button itself, but uh on the um Yeah. On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons. So Yeah, but. Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it? So um Yeah. We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or Can't uh go um Nay. Is it impossible to But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty. I don't think so. S Yeah. But, you can't use uh Yeah. But we want to make a uh so uh uh fancy and a good uh Yeah. Uh, wi with n Oh, with uh attractive uh o options. So uh, you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty. So Scroll-wheel's one. No, it Yeah. Yeah. Mm. D yeah. Hmm. Ja ja. Yeah, or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button. So Yeah Yeah it's a big advantage. But um, it's Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But if you push the teletext button twice It's uh One m uh one b uh, a few buttons. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Uh yeah. But uh, you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one. Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved. It uh it's a bit uh.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The th No. But um But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios. Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels. So maybe it's uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But very special, so uh No. Mm. Yeah? Mm. 'Kay. Uh six. Yeah. Mm. Sh Yeah. Mm. Not really. For old people I I W Yeah. Four. Yeah. N Yeah. No. Mm m Yeah. Mm, th yeah. Yeah. Uh We have to test it s But Uh, yeah, true. I go for three. So Yeah yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. But it Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.. Mm. Yeah. So Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. But Uh Yeah. A flipper's uh easier, so Yeah. But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation, it's easier to uh share it with uh other people. Uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet, or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory. So So Yeah? No? T can uh can you export it uh like a Yeah.. Uh. Uh, yeah. So you can Uh It's possible. Okay. Um, yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer. Uh, so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh So Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm yeah.. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Hmm. Where's the champagne? Uh, I believe y uh Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh maybe uh they will save it. So uh Okay. Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire. So uh Yeah. Yeah. Okay.Okay. Well this is what me and Richard came up with. The default spot for the on-off button. The mute button just below that. Then there's the volume and channel selectors. Simple plus-minus button. Uh we thought of a help button. If you hold it and you press another button, uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen. Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons. A button for teletext. A button for the subtitles. And the company logo. So it's rather simple prototype. And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it. Sure uh just pop in at any time. I think if you look at most controls, they've got more buttons than this. And well the on-off button, it's it's a necessity. You can't drop that one. The volume and channel buttons, you need you obviously need those those. The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice. So we could cancel that one. I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does. Well, you can't leave out the number buttons I guess. And Yeah. So it's rather basic already. Yeah, they're It's rather hard to draw on the white-board. But they're supposed to be equal sized, round, with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume, the the triangle and stuff. Just for recognition. So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons. With a a different colour than the case. So they jump out. And uh that's about it. Yep. Yes. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Uh that's that's a big cost. If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip. Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic. So it's not even taken into the price. We we could save money on it. But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people? My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message. So Yeah. The margin will get too small. Yeah. Ten. No remote. That's We're getting closer. Yeah. You could just not scroll for a half a second. So you won't need a button. If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip, yes. Yep. Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight? Eight hundred eighty eight. Yeah. Okay. No. We could make two buttons out of that. And just um If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel. So that would save two buttons. If you do the same for the channel. More obvious. So if we Yeah. So If we leave out all those buttons, perhaps you can go with the flat flat case. And make it smaller overall. So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button, the screen right behi under that, than the scroll button you get a a much smaller remote. And it sh Yeah? Yeah. Richard's argument was very good. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Six. Yeah. Four or five. Yes. No. Mm, we haven't thought of that one. I think that's a three. I still I think it's too m too fancy. Too too flashy. Twendag sieven an twendag. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. That's true. Yeah, there w there was enough room, but the finance uh Yes. Yes, was okay. The tasks are very structured, so you can just do step by step and it's very easy. Well, the smart-board, the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass, but The digital the digital pen is very nice. Yes. Yeah. A flip-over or a more precise uh digit Yes. No. Didn't work. Yes. Yeah. Considering we are not going to make a docking station. Perhaps. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay.Good afternoon. Sorry I'm a little late. Got stuck in the traffic. Yeah. Um, is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality? Um, when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Think so. That's what I pointed out earlier. If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here. Since it rechargeable. Um Damn. Wouldn't Yeah. No. That wouldn't be an option. Uh, d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each, right? Well, think actually there're two buttons, aren't they? Well I was thinking, maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button. That would cut the cost. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But, I think this really is four buttons anyhow. Yes. Only the docking station, I guess. Maybe we should to a different supplier. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. Um Well, since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier, more easy, maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little. Especially since we have those nice features. It would be a be a pretty rigid one. Or b Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost, or just any other remote control. But how does scroll-wheel work here? That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also. Integrated scroll-wheel push-button. But Yeah. I think that would be like the end of our usability. Yeah, but Well, think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button, go to page eight eight eight, and teletext disappears. But the subtitles stay there. I think that's the case on most Well, that could be just uh like the scroll to eight, click, scroll to eight, click, scroll to eight, click. But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people, who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is. Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero. With only five buttons on it. And a scroll-wheel. True. True. That's a pretty big scroll wheel. So this is five buttons. Right now we have five. Mm. Well, I still think we should go for the single curve design. But then again, all these changes are not really okay with me. But since we just have to. I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote. Or do some market research and see what the options are. Yeah. Yes. Definitely. Yeah. It's pretty different. But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote. This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell. 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff. This is not familiar for them. So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them. Yeah. That's true. Might uh might be confusing too. They'd be like, what? Only five buttons? Yeah. But you're not sixty. Mm-hmm. So um, I like set up all these criteria. And evaluation of the thingy. Thank you. Five more minutes? Okay. 'Kay so I did some literature study study, and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier. Translated it into criteria, which would be these. Um, is the remote fancy? The shape, look and feel. Innovative? What new functions are there? Uh, easy to use? Uh, learnability is a very important factor here. Uh, is it functional? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions? And are the those functions that are there, are they useful? And the cost. The target group. Is the remote really for the group we're making it for? And recognability. If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it? And So we're supposed to evaluate it right now. Let's see. Oh I have to say this was a little hard, because the minutes of our last meeting were not here. Okay. Interesting. So Is the design fancy, on a scale of one to seven? We all go for six? Good. Um, is the design innovative? I think so, with our L_C_D_ screen, docking station, scroll-buttons. Seven? Should be do-able. Is the design easy to use? Well Would be for us. But I'd go for four, too. Is the design functional? Um, do we have all functions that we want to include? I think we do. Do we have too many functions? I don't think so. It's pretty slim. Seven. Oh, and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control? Like it getting lost and R_S_I_ influences? Think we do. Are the production costs within the preset limits? Well they are now. Does the design fit the group of focus? Yeah. I think it doesn't. I don't know. I think I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control. I'm not sure. I think I'd go for two. 'Kay. Is the company company recognisable? Well, we have the logo there. So Yeah. So that will be this. I was also supposed to calculate the score, but thought we would have another private thingy after this. Is this Like after this, are we done? Or We're gonna go to our other room again. Well, anyhow. These are seven factors times seven is forty something. Two? No. Nine? Uh, minus one. Minus three, minus four. Minus four. So that would be minus eight. Forty one out of forty nine. Okay. Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here. Hmm. 'Kay. So that will be the evaluation. Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier. In the design phase. Yeah. Definitely. No. Not too much. No. Yeah, true. But And I would've liked to go for the younger users also. And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I tried to open the file on my laptop, but not possible. Yeah. no. Should've done that then. Pen is here. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. They are. Yeah. Fifty grand. Yeah. Yeah, still I think I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people. So maybe we should just re-focus. Or specifically for younger people. That's true. Yeah, I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is, than would be with older people. Even if it were their covers.

In the detailed design meeting the team created a prototype. Along with buttons for numbers, channel selector, volume, mute, on-off, teletext, and subtitles, the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information. One rechargable battery, single-curve form and plastic case, brought the total cost to 17 Euros. To reduce this cost, it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel. The remaining buttons were one for channel selection, one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel), teletext, on-off and the help button. A suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval. All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype. It was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (6), technological innovation (4), functionality (7), consideration of the target group (3). The remote was also recognisable as a fashionable Real Reaction product. The project process was deemed well-structured, although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage. Teamword and leadership were good, but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints. 
2	Okay. Everybody found his place again? Yeah? That's nice. Okay so this is our second meeting. And uh still failing? Uh now we're going um into the functional design. Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements, technical function design, and the working design. So that we can move onto the second uh phase. But first this phase. Um first an announcement. There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system. So There's our ghost mouse again. That that means that you can have a little trouble with, little trouble with the air conditioning, that's because of this uh It's in wing C_ and E_. So it should be over in a in a while, couple of days. But it's going to be cold anyway, so I don't think you're gonna need it. Then our agenda. Now first the opening. Uh this time I will take the minutes. Uh you're going to have a presentation. All of you. Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations. So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation, and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me. And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include. So we've got forty minutes for all of it. So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation. Um who wants to be first? Okay. So Just maybe it's easier if you um Yeah I think you will tell your presentation as well. Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about. Okay. Thank you. So anybody have um any questions until now? About functional requirements? Okay that's clear. Now to the second. Yeah. Yeah you can take your time. We've got uh plenty of time, so Yeah. There it is. Yeah. One remote. Hmm. 'Kay. Yeah. Okay. Anybody has questions about the technical functions? Yeah. Touchscreen. Huh. 'Kay. That's nice. Uh Yeah. That's right. Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation? Uh And then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design. I think it's going to Uh it's not too much. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Uh Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now. Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements. Um that's, we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_. Um that's because uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big, if we wanna have it uh for more functions. So it has to be simple. Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext, because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past. And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control. Um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use. Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well. Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus. Uh that's the the market we have to to to target, because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers. Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert. Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons. So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control, and the other way round. And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product. So it has to be visible in our design, in the way our device works. And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well. So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions. Yeah. Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product. Um Against the no teletext? Um Yeah it's it is Standard remote. No I think we can I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned. Uh if we put a lot of effort in those, we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons. Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market. And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus, fifty plus, it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now. No. But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market, that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it. So let's try it. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big success. Very big success. Yeah. Uh. I think so as well. Uh I simply think um uh that the new products we are gonna make, uh spef specifically design, are designed for uh younger people, uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people. And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls. 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important. Volume selection, power and teletext. Okay. Um No we we haven't voted yet, so Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well. But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost, because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well, but I don't think it will be a problem. Or is teletext a Yeah. Yeah. So I suggest uh Yeah. Is anybody um really against teletext? No? Just that, that we just keep the teletext. I think that's a good idea as well, especially for the subtitles. Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control, if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles, which is instantly on the remote control. For elderly people they can think, oh I wanna have subtitles, and they push the button and they get the big subtitles. Um so I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage. Um Functionality should be few buttons, you said. I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons. So to keep it simple. No. Yeah. But do you need But do you need the buttons for one to zero. Maybe c we can Maybe we can use uh No, maybe we can implement the scroll button? Or a joystick like? There are other ways too. Just look if you look at telephones. The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or That's right. the numbers yeah. Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display, and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it. But I think there won't be very much buttons. Or there don't have to be a lot. The number of buttons? I think it's very important in the in the design. You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places. And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with To operate only the T_V_ yeah. No. So. 'Kay. So we can Yeah. That's right. Yeah. So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station. Uh uh like other functions. Instead of f of less buttons. Mm. No. Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have? 'Cause it can be No. Yeah. Because I think that's uh That's a good advantage point as well. If we have a fancy-looking docking station or very That's a nice requirement. Docking station. I think so. Yeah. That's a good point. Um You said they easily get lost as well. Yeah. So maybe we should implement the audio sign, or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So audio signal should be possible as well. I think it's not too expensive. Uh another point is the L_C_D_ screen. Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much, because Yeah. It will be too much as well. Yeah. Based. Just the L_C_D_. Oh just the normal screen. That's a good idea. So Some extra info. Feedback. Yeah. I think that's a good idea as well. As the small screen. Extra button info. I think that should be possible as well. Um let's see what did we say. Mm. More. Should be fancy to, fancy design, easy to learn. Few buttons, we talked about that. Docking station, L_C_D_. Um general functions Yeah. 'Kay. And default materials. I think that's a good idea as well, because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one. So that doesn't really matter. So I think we nee Uh let's um specify the target group. Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty. Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty, maybe. Uh what do we want? If we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people, we can target the real elderly people. Yeah. So that's the Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example. Yeah. Sixty. Okay. And different cultures. Are we Okay. No. We've got five minutes left just now. Small warning. Should Yeah. In different languages, you know. Yeah. or you have to put a language button in it, but that will be a bit unnecessary I think. It's better to put it on different markets with it all. Okay. So that's the the target. Uh then a few small things. Uh okay. I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder. Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept, User Interface Designer the user interface concept, and the trend-watching. So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group, uh requirements, and the trends which are uh going on. And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach. So um I thank you for this meeting. And I think we have a lunch-break now. So that's a good thing.No. Well I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros. But the It wouldn't be very robust. It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it. That's. Okay. Okay I've got a presentation about the working design. Um first about how it works. It's really simple of course. Everybody knows how a remote works. The user presses a button. The remote determines what button it is, uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_. The T_V_ switches to the frequency, or what function it is. So we've got um the the plate. It gots conductive disks for every button. When the user presses a button, a signal got sent, goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_. It's a very simple device, technically speaking. So this is a schematic overview. You've got the buttons. The power source. And uh when a button gets pressed, its goes to the chip. The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb. When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button. Well um I think we should use default materials, simple plastics. Keep the inner workings simple, so it's robust. Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design and the user interface, because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high. And uh you only have to design a remote once, and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product. So it's, in my idea, it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself. That's it. I think that if we're If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um I don't know if you've heard about it in the news, the the elderly mobile phone? Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money, I think. We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality. We just change our focus on the project, and I think we can uh we can sell this. No. Uh that's a good idea. Yeah. And besides that it's um If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt. They're not used to using scroll buttons. So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout. It should be possible yes. If it's not too fancy. And if the remote stays rather small, it should be possible yeah. Yes. So we're just gonna focus on the extras? Yeah. Like with your key-chain, if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound. Yeah. Y i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen, 'cause it's uh Well I don't think they have different television sets uh in uh every country. 'Cause Yeah. Yeah.Yes. Yeah. Okay. No. Yes. Think I'll go first. 'Kay. My name is Freek Van Ponnen. I'm the Market Expert. But you already knew that. Um I've done some research. We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls. Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire. We had one hundred of these uh test subjects. Uh in addition we did some market research. Uh see what the market consists of. What ages are involved. Well these are three quite astonishing results, I thought. Um remotes are being considered ugly. F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly. Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control. So Um in addition remotes were not very functional. Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control. And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room. So some things. Then we did some research to the most relevant functions. Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy. The power button got a nine. And teletext got a six and a half. So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control. Then there are some one-time use function. That's what I like to call them. That uh audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons. Which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance. Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently. One hundred and sixty eight times per hour. Then these are the This is the market. Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six. Um Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control. Um they like to use new f new functions. But they also are very critical. They won't spend their money very easily. So Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market. They are not really very interested in features. But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier. Um What I think this indicates for our um design. I think we should make a remote for the future. And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five. Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market, so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable. Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design. Um The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_. Um this is certainly something to take into account. And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control, remote control. So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design. Besides of course that the remote must look very nice. And the functionality As a lot of people indicated, they only use about ten percent of the buttons, I think we should make very few buttons. Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote. Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised. Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons. 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust. They shouldn't break down easily. Um Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room, it might be and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot. But it might be a good idea to make a docking station. And this would, could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep. So you'd know where it is in the room. And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in. Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred. This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five. But up till forty five it remains feasible. This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider. That would be all. Any questions? 'Kay. Yeah you should go to the top thingy. Slide show. Oh yeah. Hmm. Well it would certainly make a fancy design. So That is true. We would have to look into that. Yeah. So is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement? Yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon. And new T_V_s will have internet access on them. But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus, the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim. In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control. So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it. I'm pretty much against it. Yes. Besides that, I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small. But I mean if I s if I see this, it's I think we're just gonna go for another pretty and not innovative remote control. Yes but it's not the biggest part of the market. And besides that, they're not very critical so I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like. They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable. No. I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category. because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control. People of forty plus, I mean they want it to work, but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them. So I haven't heard of it. Hmm. Yes. Yes. But obviously the board tends to disagree. Yeah, also. I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext. Yes. Mm-hmm. But I don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause Well might be. But I mean it, if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway. You need a one to zero button, next channel, previous channel, volume up, volume down, and some teletext buttons but I think if you if you only l Nah. Think if you're gonna include teletext you do. I think many people like to use that. 'Cause if you should, if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five, you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times. That's true but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast. And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it. And I dunno if many channels would do have that. If many T_V_s have that. Mm-hmm. But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_, you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible. 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_, which already only have the minimum number of buttons. I don't think there's much to be gained in that area. Yeah. That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_. 'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required. There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either. So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here. That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition which was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot. Maybe. Well yeah I think, mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and But I don't think we should spend very much time in that. Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control. Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost. Yeah that was what I suggested. You have it on Yeah you have it's on some phones too, which have a docking station. And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing. So you know where it is. I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn, and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices, it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it, which would explain a button if you press it. Which would tell you what it does. And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen, but Just a small screen with two Yeah. But I dunno if that would that would fit into the costs. No. I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters. Yeah. I think I think that would be a If we should do something like that it would be a, I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company. And I think, I think there would be a good market for it. If we're able to really bring an innovative product. Yeah the really But I'd have to look into that a little more. 'Kay. And with uh the little screen in it, which explains the buttons. You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to adapt it to different cultures. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. That's good.Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh okay. Um I've been looking at uh the user interface of it. Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it. Um Okay. Mm? Oh. Uh. Okay. Um yeah. I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control. Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it, Um about uh interface but uh Uh Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control. Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television, uh stereo. So um But uh it must be uh user-friendly. So um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh Yeah. Uh uh uh Yeah. In one um remote control. But um Yeah. Um yeah. Got uh many functions in one uh remote control, um but um yeah you can see, this is uh quite simple uh remote control. Um few uh buttons but uh This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons. Um uh people uh don't like it, uh so um Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are. So uh like uh the on-off uh button. Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button. Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that. Um My personal uh preferences um. Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device. So um Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um Uh this the remote control uh and uh you got here the general functions, uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh I dunno um And um here you've got a s kind of a display. It's a touchscreen. So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh. And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device. So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons. So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device. So uh that's uh my uh idea about it. Um yeah and Uh let's see. Uh yeah. So a touchscreen. Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um. We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah. Everybody uh have to use it so Uh ol even even old people um young people. So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large. So uh Um Yeah. Uh yeah. That was uh my uh part of it. So N I I don't think so. Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen. S um it's uh not uh in colour or something. Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh yeah. Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago. Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh. So it's possible. Yeah. Yeah that's true. Uh. Okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. forty Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles. So it's Yeah. It's Mm. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If it's only for televi Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we can s we can skip the display, so uh we don't need it. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. No. No. No. Hmm. Mm. Hm. No. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. No. So 'Kay. Yeah. Right. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.@highlightThe project manager stated the agenda and the marketing expert discussed what functions are most relevant on a remote, what the target demographic is, and what his vision for the appearance of the remote is.@highlightThe marketing expert also brought up the idea to include a docking station to prevent the remote from getting lost and the idea to include an LCD screen.@highlightThe user interface designer pushed for a user-friendly interface with large buttons, a display function, a touchscreen, and the capability of controlling different devices.@highlightThe industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by.@highlightThe team then discussed teletext, the target demographic, the buttons the remote should have, the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly, an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost, LCD screens, and language options.

3	Hi. Oh. Good morning. I'm Juergen Toffs. I'm the User Interface Designer. Ach. Ooph. Very artistic. Okay. Wow. He does have body uh Huh. You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing. Or You have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh Oh. Uh hmm. Okay. Oh. It's a very bloody cat. It's a frog. Uh it's an apple. A dog? Huh? Oh, it is a turtle. It's uh inside its shell. You'll be uh finished sooner. Wow. Yes. Okay. Wha Thank you. Yeah. Um How did it work? Performance? And a pen? Um Well, very good. I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one. Well, we had a dog, a few years ago. And and it, yeah, when it died we didn't get a new one or something. But uh Uh a Graphical User Designer, so Hey. Oh. No. Can work together. Ah colour. Well, it's okay. Yeah. Uh-oh. Oh, he is the artistic design. Remote control animal. Well with the interface, it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh. Than on the, with Yeah, I m I mean like uh like on here, drawing drawing uh. And then displaying on screen, but Too expensive, yeah. A green rabbit. There, the g white green rabbit. He's a little bit stoned there. Yeah, how much is it? Hundred million uh remotes or something? Oh yeah. Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels. And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible. Uh Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen? Uh but um which The ones we made on the Oh, only in Word, okay. For what purpose? We And and the price. Okay. And him. Yeah. Um one thing uh, we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make. Do we Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems? Or uh We should have some agreement on that before we Okay. Ah okay. Consensus on the, what we're gonna do. Yeah. Well yeah, if the technical functions have to be designed, I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be. Or do we use it a text screen? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Sorry. Yes. Yeah. No. Come up.Hi. Morning. Hi, my name's uh. I'm the Industrial Designer. By the way, why was your cat uh red? Oh, okay. Oh, yeah, sure. No, it's a turtle. Must be a dog. Yeah. Uh. Hmm. Yeah, sure. Uh thanks. I figure I should do something like that, but I'm gonna do something much more difficult. Exactly. Uh Yes. No. No. Yeah, exactly. So. Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit. Uh uh Uh well. Where does the pen go? Just uh Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive. Oh, sorry. Twenty million. Two million, oh yeah, two million. Yeah. And and him. I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually. Yeah. Yeah, actually it is. Then looking at individual components, so that's actually a f step further. Yeah, we can take it from there. Yeah, I agree uh, we can take it from there. Or edit. Okay, cheers.Good morning. By Big Brother? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Of our faces. I'm uh Tim. Um my function is the Marketing Expert. Speaks for itself. I have a question. Um this exercise, um did the company board tell you to do it, or uh did you just make it up yourself? It's part of the introduction, okay. Okay. Um, yeah. I don't know really how it works. But maybe you can show us first? You g you get electrocuted or It's like Pictionary? The the one who says it first gets a raise. It's a pork? Mm yeah, I have it at home. What's it called? Ah. Miniature size? Okay. Okay. We have to speed up. Remember you use uh different colours, and different pen widths. I Okay. Save it. You have to save it. I've done it. New? 'Kay. Mm uh Not really. Um That one. Yeah? Okay. Open. Which one is it? Smart board? Okay. And now? Okay. Okay, thanks. 'Kay, I've speed up. 'Kay, that's fine. Line width. It's not an apple. Hmm. Colour. Something like this. Smaller. Um 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles. Uh? No, it's uh No no. It's coming up. Mm. Uh. Something like this. Okay, you know Very artistic. Yeah? Here you go. Uh the big lines were like nine. Uh, it's p It's pretty good uh An artist. Think you uh picked the wrong uh function. Wrong job. Wha That's enough, thanks. I wonder. I'm gonna design a remote uh remote control animal. Oh. Sorry. Yeah. That that might be easier. But at the other hand, uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand, and I think it's easier to draw. Yeah. With a pen than with a mouse mouse. Mouth. Oh, okay. Yeah. W with this paper it's too mu too expensive. It's a rabbit with uh broken legs? Yeah. It will do. Project Manager? Uh Have you been uh counting the time? Okay. Let's go on then. It's pretty abstract. Like how much? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Uh but I have some points. Can I show them on the on the big screen? Maybe? Yeah. Yeah, I can find Uh. Screen? Okay. Okay, I have some uh points from marketing point of view. Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive, uh small, fairly cheap. Uh it's pretty cheap, twenty five Euros. Uh brand independent. Um I think, it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is. Um Five minutes? Okay, I'll wrap it up quickly. Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose. Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose. And uh by making it multi-purpose, it uh has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from uh from current products. Um maybe some other technology than infrared. Uh I rather find it very annoying um, like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it. Um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth. That might be a little bit uh expensive. Um And something like an L_C_D_ screen. Um uh like I said here um Maybe it's easy. It's nice as an added feature feature, that um, when you're on a certain channel, you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or From my point of view, yeah. Yeah, it has to be uh Yeah, our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things. So i i i i To the current market. Look, you got some cheap uh remote controls there. They just uh Yeah, you got a dozen of 'em. But when you enter a new market with a remote control and uh wanna gain market share you have to do something special, I think. Yeah. Yeah, of course. But it's But but this is just from marketing uh aspect. I don't know anything about user interface or design. Mm uh I I don't think we have to be, we have to agree on that. Uh I think th that's a pha Yeah. That's a phase further. Ju just uh make some mock-ups, some some general ideas. And and then we can plan Yeah. We can plan further, I think. Mm yeah. I don't know. You decide. You're the Project Manager. Uh tha that's a same step further. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it, or how it has to be like. And then in the next meeting we decide w what it's gonna be. A And then you s then you can delete uh the o the obsolete uh details. I think. Yeah. Yeah. Damn. Success?Hello. Good morning. Uh before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in, uh because we're uh being watched by uh Big Brother. So um Yeah. Yeah. This uh These are cameras, so are these. This thing uh that looks like a pie, are actually all microphones. So you must be careful with uh with uh all this. And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be. And that has to do with the camera settings, so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras. And Indeed. So they can see our faces. Okay. Welcome at the kick-off meeting. My name is uh Danny Wolfs. Uh this is the agenda for today. Uh first a little opening. Uh I will introduce myself, uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself. Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance, acquaintance to uh to to ourselves. So uh we get to know each other. Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards. Then the project plan. What we're going to do, and how we're going to do it. Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end. Okay uh, my name is uh Danny Wolfs. I'm the Project Manager. What's your name? User interface, okay. Industrial, yes. Okay, thank you. First a little about the project aim. Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control. Uh maybe you have read uh read the website. It's a very uh, yeah, very uh ambitious uh company. They uh they wanna do something else. I w Uh there must be a new remote control. Uh first of all uh it must be original, uh and trendy. That's two things really uh close to each other. But at the same time uh user-friendly. And they have uh Yeah, that's uh very important uh for them. Uh there are three stages. There is a functional design. So uh what are we going uh to uh to do? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote? And why are we going to do it? Then the conceptual design. How are going to do it? And that's uh really global. Uh because at the detailed design, how, part two, uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of If it's uh it's possible technical-wise. Uh each stage is uh uh is broken up in two uh two stages, individual work and a meeting. So it's uh it's very straightforward. Okay, the tool training. We have two smart boards. This one is for the presentations, the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had. Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing. So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme. This is called a smart board thing uh Yeah, it speaks for itself. Um and as you uh may have heard, the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen. Not in y the the My Documents. So if you wanna show something, put it in the shared folder. Uh This uh is very straightforward, with the save, the print, the undo, the blank, the select, the pen. Well, I don't uh gonna explain it all, because I think you know uh how it works. Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here, uh all must be saved. We we may not delete anything. So uh if you have uh drawn something, save it. Never delete it. That's a very important uh thing. Okay. Uh little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other. At uh the white board on the left. Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal, and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal. Uh important is that we use different colours, and uh different pen widths. Widths. Widths. Yes? Yeah. No no no. It's uh it's uh I I I must do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 'Cause we uh really don't know each other, and uh it's kinda new. So getting used to each other, we can uh have a little fun then, before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff. That kind of thing. Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal? Okay, okay. Yeah, okay. Drawing goes with uh this thing. Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here. That's uh important. So hold it uh like this. Yeah, kinda. So, um You must p p uh push a little uh Good. Because And uh wait uh wait a few seconds. It's not uh fully real-time, so uh watch it. Oh yeah. Well I'm gonna paint in the red. Oh. That's the background colour. Well, undo. Um The pen? No. One minute please. Yeah, that's the one. Well, five. Okay. My favourite animal huh? Yeah, you can guess what it is. May uh paint uh next. No, it's not an orc. You don't see it uh at the ears? You have an orc at home? Thank you. So it's a cat. Simba. 'Cause uh we have a cat at home and he's called Simba. 'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King. So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion. He's happy with us, so uh he's smiling. No, only the face. Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes. So we uh Yeah. Yeah. Okay, who wants to go next? Yeah? So choose a colour, choose a pen width and draw a Yeah. Save it, okay. Kind of firm touch. Yeah. Because uh my cat is red uh at home. And I have red hair, so uh must be red. It is a turtle. Why a turtle? Why? Tim? You watched it a lot? You watched it a lot? It's a scared turtle. Okay, Tim. Thank you. Jurgen, you want to go next? Format? And then you have the the current colour, you can change. So no red or green. And uh line uh width. I had five. Tim had Uh Tim, what kinda line width did you have? Okay. It's a dog. Okay. Why a dog? You have a dog at home? Had a dog? Yeah? Ah. You have an artistic uh inner middle. So I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use. Not difficult at all. Okay, thank you. Janus? The last one? Yeah. After a cat, a turtle and a dog. I think he's gonna draw an elephant. Uh-oh. No. Better to draw with a with But what is he uh? Is it a rabbit? Do you have a rabbit at home? Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix. Okay, then yeah. Okay. Finishing touch and then we're going further. Yeah? Yeah, a little. Well, I think the dog is the the most uh artistic. Don't choose for youself. That's selfish. Okay, now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff. Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro, and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro. So uh from my point of view, I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech, high definition, uh ultra modern uh kinda remote, for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro. Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro. So that's a lot. We have to sell uh a lot of uh Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five, uh uh you got two million, two million remotes. But our marketing range is uh, market range is international. So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to. At least that uh countries which have uh a television. Um So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things. You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself, at home. What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature. What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others. Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little. I'm gonna join you at the table. Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control? Okay. So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and Or just only If you have them on uh I can uh Okay. Oh, in case you want it This is a dead kind of fly. Between the the the, yeah, the the uh Yeah, be The screens. No no no. Only All the drawings go there, at the left uh Oh, that pen drawings. Uh no, I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder, you can show it there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Five minutes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh remote? Yeah, it must be really uh innovative, technical-wise? Yeah. So yeah, I I agree with you. So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to Yeah. No. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. But we have to keep an eye that it's Uh at the beginning of such a project, it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about, well, this would be cool, that would be cool. Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh Yeah okay. Yeah. Okay. And that's because we have him. Okay, uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes. So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback, uh via the m the mail. Um the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design. Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions. So that's the thing we uh discussed. Yeah? Okay. Um wha Yeah. Yeah. But maybe, because uh you are working on the user requirements, you are working on the technical functions, we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh How do you call it? Uh Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do. So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all. Some basic things we co we want to going to do. Uh I think that's well uh Yeah. Will come in handy. Okay. W He says Yeah. Well, th that's that's really a step further. But if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose, that's a Why? Why? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important. And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting. I must finish off now, so it's over. You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach. And I see you in uh thirty minutes. Thank you.

4	Morning. Yep. My name's Frank. Thank you. Hmm, that's interesting. Sure. Yep. Visit it. Can't say I paid much attention to it, but Oh yeah. Okay. 'Kay. That was interesting. Innocent. 'Kay. I'm thinking about a swordfish.. Meat. Yeah. Hmm. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Gonna use a different line width. And I'm gonna draw in black. There. 'Kay, I'm not much of an artist, but here we go. Mm. Okay. This is my um Hmm. Sheep. With of course little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts. There. Yeah. 'Kay. They are Come on. You have to go really slow when you're writing. They're brilliant animal animals. And that's just a little me thingy. So. Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer. Interesting. A rabbit? Garfield. Yeah. Yeah. And the most interesting tail. Yeah. We're being haunted. Yeah, you got a message. So just on a side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen? Yeah. Right. No. It's off now. Well, it was on, but Ah, there we are. Well, we have a kind of broad T_V_ at home, and a D_V_D_ player, so we got like a lot of remote controls, one for the T_V_, one for the video recorder, one for the D_V_D_ player. And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all. Oh really. Yeah. Yeah. So I think you can take minutes again. Since it's your job. Yeah. Yeah. But that would be really good if we could do that. Um. Think it has to be shock proof 'cause my remote control tends to fall a lot. So Yeah, one other little thing. Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it. So you can see how much is left in the battery. But they'll also really drag up the production costs, so think we'll have to see about that too. But maybe just a little LED, I don't know. Um. Nope, don't think so. Okay. Aye sir. Half an hour. Okay.Morning. Mm-hmm. Garfield. Well I was gonna draw a cat too, so. I'll just try something else. Something different than Garfield. Mine is a bit more skinny. But uh Well, it's supposed to be a cat. I like cats because uh they are uh independent. The pen. So. The pen. No, me neither. Nope. They were all mentioned, so Okay.Morning. I'm. Yep. Hmm? Okay. Yeah. Yep. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. A sheep. Okay. Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head, but mm Let's see. Mm. Uh. Okay. Yeah. You know what that is? Or who? Ah okay, yeah. Just a Mm. Guess. So uh Yeah. That's enough. Um, you say a blank, or Okay. Five minutes, okay. Mm? Mm. Oh really? Huh. It's a Sure. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Hmm. Oh. Mm-hmm. Oh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Sure, yeah. Waterproof, or uh Uh, you never no know uh, I w I mean uh 'Kay. Okay, yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Yep.So uh good morning. I see you all find your places. Is everybody sitting on the right place? Yeah? I guess so. So Let's see. First I will introduce myself. I don't know if uh if everybody knows me, so I'm Bart, hello. Hello. Bart. Hello. Hello. Bart. Welcome. Uh let's see. Uh let's start off um with a little presentation. Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting. You can see there are a few cameras here. They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice. Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those, because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it. So is there a project documents folder? There are some notes in it already I see, some documents. Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off. Is being modified by the administrator. Uh okay. Let's do it read only. Well I don't know if you've noticed, but uh we're working for Real Reaction. Uh it's a company in uh electronics. We put fashion in electronics, uh we make it work, uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself. I'm Bart the project manager so I'll direct you through the project. This is our agenda. Uh we have our opening acquaintance, tool training, project plan description closing. Uh maybe I can sit down, then I can take some notes or Let's see. Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while. I dunno it's not a lot of work, but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down, just write it down. Uh as you can see uh it's the opening, aquaintance tool training. Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit. Um have you all seen the corporate website already? Yeah. Have you seen any flaws in it? I think I found one. No? I can see if it works this way. No, it doesn't work here. Okay no problem. But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction. Real Remote is not really the company we're we are, but it's just a little fault. Um okay, what are we going to do? Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control. It has to be original, trendy, and user friendly. So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you. We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look. And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original. And we've got our User Interface Designer. He's also uh That's about the new remote control. Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through. First is functional des uh design, individual work, meetings. After the functional design, then the conceptual design and the detailed design. I had some role indications on here. But I think you know it already by yourself. The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design, uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design. Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept and user interface design. And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification, trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation. So that's a bit what you're going to do. But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings. Then we've got our first tool training. We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here, so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first. As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board. Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side. Here are some functions. You can save. N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with, only undo, you can undo a little uh piece of drawing. A blank new document for each person. Uh select a pen, eraser. Capture we don't have to do anything with. Uh then we've got our pen. This pen. It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of. You can also select the current colour and the line width. But then first you have to select the pen function. But we're going to work with it in a minute. So okay. Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there. Uh then a short thing about documents. We've got our shared folder, uh project project what was it? Project documents I think. But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already, so it will be okay. And these are available on the smart boards as well, so if you have a document you wanna show, just open it from the folder. Here is a simple tool bar. It's what I just said, it's save, print, move back or forward one page. You can switch between the different drawings. And then we're going to try out the white board. So as you can see we g all going to draw a animal. Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it. Mouse wasn't running away. Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse? No. Okay. We're going to uh draw animal. And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics. Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours, and different line width. Uh there's I can start from now. I will. You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child. Because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good. Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow. 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up. So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate. Then the line width. I think seven will be nice. Now you'll see my drawing capabilities. These are not very much, but uh Uh, see you have to do it real slow. Oh Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin, but I think his nose has to be a little bit But it's close. So what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish. Yeah, he hasn't got an eye. Woah. Now we've got another function. We've got the eraser. And then you can undo this easily. Ah it's okay. And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics. Uh is They've got no text tool, no. Uh. Okay. This is typically a undo action, I think. Pen. Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down. I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe. But I don't know, I'm just trying. This is not my work, okay. Maybe you have to use Oh. Uh. I think it's a it wants to draw a another animal? I don't know. It lives for the fun. So It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin. It lives for the fun. So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you. Go ahead. Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width, I think. Because this is going a lot better than uh I did. It's nice. Uh. It's a real dead sheep, yeah. For recognition, yeah, I see. Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere. On just a Yeah. Nice. Sweet. Yeah, just a blank sheet. No. Yeah, it's pretty skinny cat. Is your cat, or did you find him on the street? Ah. Okay. That's pretty clear. So everybody knows how to work with the white board now? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board, just ask and go ahead. It's pretty uh easy. 'Kay. S haunted white board. So we've got the tool uh introduction. We move along to the project finance. Um as you can see, we um for our remote control, a selling price is uh twenty five Euros. Our selling price. Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros. Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls, so we have to work together to reach our aims. Uh we can do it international, so we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures, and different kind of trends as well. Um but that's all in the later stadium. Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros, so that's also a point we have to keep in mind, that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside, and stuff like that. It won't work. So just try to remember these points. Selling price twenty five, profit aims fifty million um, but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on. And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros. So that's leads us to our little discussion. We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion. So I'm gonna sit down, I think. It's easier. I've got a message. Five minutes. Okay, that's uh good timing. Uh maybe you have to say the magic word. Does it do anything? Maybe you have to just clap it down? Mm back up again. No slide show. Hmm. It's off. Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah. You'll be okay, I think. Well it's those laptops. Nice. Okay. But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls, and I mean not the ordinary mote controls, but also a little bit different ones? Like you can use for other? No? You? Ah yeah. Yep. Yeah I've I've got one at home. And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it, and you can use it for your television, anything else. And it also operates on infra-red, so you have to got the little device inside your room, and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor. So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor. So that's a pretty handy um thing. Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well. It's uh That's good to remember. Yeah, that's nice, I think. So we've we want different functions uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red. But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs. So that uh that's something we have to find out, I think. And other functions for a remote control? Maybe we can make it uh uh Shock proof. Sure. Waterproof. Okay. So these are our um a few things we can think of. Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder. That's a battery stays. Yeah. Uh. That's an idea as well. Other ideas? Quick ideas. Okay. Any questions about this uh presentation? Kick off presentation. No? Okay, then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder, and then we can all work. Finish meeting now. Okay. And we can all work uh on our own projects. Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour, I think. So good luck.@highlightThe project manager introduced himself to the team and then acquainted the team with the audio and video equipment in the meeting room.@highlightThe project manager briefly described the company the team works for and discussed the corporate website.@highlightThe project manager then described the upcoming project and the roles of each team member.@highlightThe project manager introduced the smart boards to the team and led the team members in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and described why they liked the animal.@highlightThe project manager briefed the team on the project budget and selling prices for the remote they are to create and led them in a discussion on their experiences with remote controls and what features they would like to include in their product.

5	Help. It's up there? That screen's black. Alright, okay. Okay, that's fine. Are we done? Right, okay um, this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place. Um, right our agenda for today, do you want us to give you a second? Okay, um I'll go over what we decided last meeting, um, we decided upon a universal control, one handset for all, T_V_, video equipment. Um, that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limiting anyone. We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product, we put fashion in electronics, you know that kind of s thing. Um, our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget, um that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it, okay. Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like. Um want it to look uncluttered, undaunting to the customer. We discussed a flip-open design, um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming, things like that. Okay. Um, three presentations, I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first? No that's fine, that's fine. Unplug me. Um, F_N_ function F_ eight. Mm-hmm. They are. Okay, thank you very much. Um, would you like to continue on from that? Or, maybe move the laptop over. F_ function. Oh, there. 'Kay. Um, I think we'll chat about it at the end, okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end, um Ooh, it's vibrating, that's strange. Oh, God. Right, okay. We just do the best we can. Yeah, you might. Ah. Look at that. Okay. Yeah. Right, um we have new project requirements, um we're not going to be using teletext, um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now. Um our control is only going to be for T_V_, it's not going to be a combined control, which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us, but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer. It says for T_V_ only, so looks like it's just yeah, I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it, but I don't know, what do you think? It just said, for T_V_ only. But I mean, general T_V_ controls do do video as well. I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you? Mm. I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming. Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, bu We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves, so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose, you were saying whistling, maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote, you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps and you're like oh okay it's over there, something like that, but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me. Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset. Um so we want logo, we want um fashionable, trendy, I mean what you were talking about with the marketing. Um, people paying more for it to look good. Um, we need to focus on that as well. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What about you were talking about the buttons, um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big, rubber buttons, not tiny little one, big, rubber buttons, but what about, I mean, 'cause we got to make it original, what about um you know with the touch screen computers yeah? Um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either, not sure about the You don't have to press it, you just have to put your thumb onto it. Um, think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan, I'm thinking uh young, um office people, trendy kind of a thing. Um, but quite, um, easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations, um Were too big. Mm. I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller, or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly, um. It's gonna be the same, so we need to focus on just one thing, not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities, um. Or a speech recognition, which is extremely expensive, I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue. We are we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well. That they want um it to be fashionable, they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations. Now with the baby boomers, the older generations are actually larger, they have a greater population than us young people, but I don't think we're focusing on that, I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um, business kind of class type people. Mm-hmm. Okay, so the remote control functions. Um we've got the T_V_, we've got the video, now there's um I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of programme details, yes. We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that, is that I always found that really easy when I discovered it, um because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on, that's fine, but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to, you put the number in and it's just a number, it's not a date, it's not a time, it's not a channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that, it's just a number. No. You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway. It is after um if you look in the newspaper, T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five, six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times, um and it has been around for quite a long time. No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that Mm. Okay so Mm-hmm. The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it. Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing, it's not working, what should I do? I think so. Um Instruction manuals. But I mean they're there's customer service, there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge, there's no extra, t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street, um. Mm. But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages. It does, you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it, so that should be something we think about. Um, what other functions? We need I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now, but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries, that's what I was thinking about. Mobile phone batteries, what kinda battery is that? Well they la they they last quite a long time, and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones, you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something, but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged. Um, something like that should reduce the size of it. Yeah it could be on that yeah, okay. S Yes. Rechargeable with a docking station. So the rechargeable which would be your field. Okay. Yes, which it is cheaper in the long run as well. Um, th the shape you got trendy. I don't wanna big box with lots of things, you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either, because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple, um They do. Okay so we've got a flip-screen. Um Okay. 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway. Okay. Can you look into the company logo? Um, things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product. I mean for example, if it was a C_ or something like that, you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something, um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design, while also making it quite different from anything else that's there. Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different. Or you could do um different, like you get with mobile phones, different fascias. You could have different kind of casings. So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and Yeah. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right, I think we have to round it up, um Sure. That was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions, making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel, things like that. Um it could be it c It yes, it could be uh adv advertisement feature, um rather than design feature, you know, drawing attention to that. And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual, 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful. Yeah. Um We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it, um. Yes. Yes. And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something, a beeping for being lost, um. Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible. But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the I the instruction manual, I don't know if we deal with that, um. I think Yep, and different from what's out there. Yep, I think that's us. I think you might get guidance, but um I th Instruction manuals, 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing, u um, they're everyone's got like a big pile of them, but no one really uses them. Um. Yes, right. Okay. Right, okay. I think you can email me, if there's any more questions. Um and I'll be able to not answer them.Okay, yeah I'll go first. Can I grab the Thanks. What do I have to press? Oh, F_ eight? Oh right, yeah. Okay. Maybe Yep there we go. Okay this is uh the working design, presented by me, the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire. 'Kay, this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so. What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design? Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state, whether that be the power, or the channel um or the volume, everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to. Um, so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside really. So um, yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one. Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use, wireless and, you don't need to send very much information. Um, most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now our one, I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control. Yeah sure. Um no no, if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries, they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in. Yeah the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across. Um, and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round. Um, now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work, uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose, we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller and to turn it into an i uh infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information. Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema, which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine. And then I was uh just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer. And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do. It's not a proper circuit, I'm not sure if it'd work or not, I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway, we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um which would basically, when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver, which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment. And then finally, um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good. Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base, we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about, uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have, I th that was just sort of a general point there. And that's uh yeah. Alright okay, and yeah, that's that's what I came up with there, so if you wanna Ooh. Function F_ eight yeah. No, no yeah it's just. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah sure. There we go, I've got a bit more of the cable. There we go. Uh you should be able to and yeah, there you go. Okay. Huh. T yeah yeah. I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g Yeah. If yeah and if you got if you got a Sky box, they have one of those plus boxes, you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so. Yeah. Yeah. Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway. Alright, okay. Alright, okay. Yeah. Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so I thought that could be quite a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same. Just yeah, yeah. 'Kay. Yeah, yeah that's what I was just yeah. No, well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just Yeah. Yeah. Mm. But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs, ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big because um they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh so if you I don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes yeah. Yeah, speech recognition, but yeah. Mm. Ge uh Yeah. Video plus. Yeah yeah. Just whack in the number. And you w yeah. And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that, you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway, yeah. It's not Yeah. It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things. Mm. Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series. So that yeah. But just to have that function would be would be really good. Yeah. Mm. But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having Yeah, I mean I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that. Yeah. Department, yeah. Yeah. And they're yeah, they should be f yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the uh yeah. Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones, but they come with a charger, I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh Yeah on that as well so. Yeah some sort of docking station or yeah. Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine, and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.Oh God. Uh, no that's okay, sorry. Um is it okay if I postpone that til later, I just want to get access to a little bit more information, is that okay? Mm-hmm. Could I can I interject to ask a question there, is that appropriate? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it? Mm-hmm. Right, the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not, right? Oh I see. Okay. Mm. Mm. Mm. That's a very important part, it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that, whenever you like me to present. No. The plug hasn't come out at the bottom, has it? No. Meter adjusting. Mm. 'Kay. Have I got to keep this here? Does it matter? I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I? Uh, whoops. Will it manage? Bit more, oh dear. Oh. Is that okay? Thank you, just pull it closer a little bit. Get it right over, okay, thank you. Okay, um, I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research. Um, so that's where we started, we used our our usability lab, the company's usability lab, we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public, male and female, all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab, just their general use of the remote control, you can see we had a hundred subjects there. Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarised some of them here. The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls, so it has obvious design implications there. Um, we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy, we were quite surprised by that finding, but um that's quite a high proportion of our our, you know, international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking. Um, current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall. For example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot, so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping. So again there's power implications there. Um, fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, so again a big design issue there. Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier, uh remote controls are often lost in the room, it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing, uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that. Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons, they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions. Um, um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury. You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems. Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition, again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition. Something we didn't put to them, but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light, possibly. Um, that trend reverses in the older age groups. So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features, that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses, they're not so bothered with this. I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you, but I think I'll just keep it simple, if there's any more information I can email you extra details, is that okay? Mm-hmm, so can we not programme a video with this remote control? Just channel-hopping. Would that imply video use? Mm-hmm, yes. Yes. Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons, I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video, fast-forwarding, so on and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare. So I don't know if that's something we need to look at. Mm-hmm. In fact I've just called up that table there, we asked those two questions, the table relates to both questions, so we didn't differentiate. Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen, that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control? So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there, and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group, I think that's just general fear of new technology. Oh yeah. Right. Mm. Yes. That's a super idea. Yeah. Yes, further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is, it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market. What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African, I dunno, you get the idea. It's it's gonna vary around the world. At the end of the day, th the engineering design is one thing, it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same, yes, absolutely. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm concerned, when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again, repetitive strain injury, I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough, I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that. Um, R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements. I'm j I really can't get my head round this one, this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about. Mm. I know, and it becomes ridiculous, yes I know. Yeah. Yes. Mm-hmm. Do we have to initially um, you know looking at the findings here, focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later. Do we really have to go for everyone right away? Um. Mm. And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people, young people, trendy people. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too, for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage, we want to, you know, not waste money, not be profligate and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up, first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this. Mm. Right, I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful. Ah, hmm. Right. Superb. Mm. Yes. Right. Excellent, mm-hmm. Mm. Right. Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me, I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another, but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me, to produce our own mobile phones, that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features, um, chain companies like Carphone Warehouse, you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it, they'll phone the company, you can use their telephones. Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, th you know, which button is it I press for this? Th as free as a free aspect of our service, would that not make it more attractive to them? Mm. Mm-hmm. Right. Alright. Yes If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel, but I mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video, we're not gonna put any okay, just a thought. Okay. Mm-hmm. Sure. Mm. Yeah. Not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that, yes okay. Mm. Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious, yes. Sure, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical, these long, brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface. We definitely an ob an obvious thing, a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles, we don't want that. Mm-hmm. Slightly curved, curved. Mm. Mm. I mean look at the mobile. I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea, I've not come across anything like that before, if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip-top. Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic, nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers, that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think. I think it's a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic, you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic, we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Less chance of it being lost too, it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either. It's easier to bit nice to handle. Mm-hmm. Okay. Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything. So it's no teletext, it's only for T_V_ and by implication video, our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control, um something about Videoplus. Right. Right. Right, so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_, a reminder about using Videoplus? So that they have a look at the guide and Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements, is this just that was an add-on feature? Uh-huh. Right. Right, so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature? Right. Mm, and the rechargeable batteries. Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements? Mm-hmm. That's not at the moment a requirement, it's something we're looking at, what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like. Okay. What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting? Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved? Okay. Okay. Whoops, questionnaire four. 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think.Mm-hmm. Sorry. Yep. Okay. Yep. 'Kay. It can be okay, that's okay with me. further. Oops. Why's it not working? F_ eight, right? Okay. Mm why's it in the right? Yeah, it's connecting. okay. Yeah. Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention, but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting, just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um, I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable. So purpose, as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible. And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use, rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever. But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it, will this two features together. So what the concept is to have a flip-top model. The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever, can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top. So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people. Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user. As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said? Yeah, with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also, so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly. Um, that's so this is if you ask me personally, I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that. So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design. Uh any comments like, if you want? Okay. I think you'll have to You can't It'll have to this can't be pulled. You'll have to push it a bit more. Yep. Yeah this is more than enough. Okay. Yeah I think you can pull it out now. Yeah. 'Kay. That's fine. Okay. Mm-hmm. Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that? Ten perc Mm-hmm. Okay. Pens Mm-hmm. Okay. So are we talking of a single model or maybe five, six designs? Sure. Alright. Right. The features could be same and the body could look slightly different. So Yeah. Yeah, uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use, the injuries, maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that. So, a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups, you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also, the market. Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small, yeah. Mm-hmm. We could focus on the biggest market. If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street, but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that. Simple. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back. Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box, like a chocolate. That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up, so they came up with something like this, curled up, so here, and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much, so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing, curled up like a boat. G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like. So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom, something like that. I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth. Current. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We could look in at that but Mm. What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells, logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model, rather than you know, trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like. A sea shell? Yeah we could look in at that. Yeah maybe we could come at some say five, six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like, that could be the most common design. But we can like think of five, six designs. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. For detection, right. Yep, I think True. Oops.

6	Hello. Hi. Yeah. It's too beautiful. A minute please, my uh laptop is uh oh, there it is, thank you. So welcome back. At the functional design meeting um the plan is uh that uh each one of you, so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour. I will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder. Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now, so you can read that uh now or afterwards. Um uh I had an email from the from the management board uh, I don't know if you a al also uh received it, but there were four points uh which uh I think are very important. First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus. Uh second one is also important uh, because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session. Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television, so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control, so uh that's one thing to keep in mind. Uh second, and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert, uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older, but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty. Uh and uh I think to keep in mind, but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote. So, we have uh forty minutes, so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each, and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards, the the Word files, what you uh whatever you want. So uh Tim, can you start? Yeah? Mm-hmm. But it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet. So that that's strange. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's a cool idea. Yeah. Thank you, Tim. Janus, can you uh Okay, thank you Janus. You do? The last presentation. You have plenty of time, Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes, so uh take your time. If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh warn you. Uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one, so uh you you want to keep it simple, but I think that if you want to do that, then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen. Jirun? Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Okay. But let's not uh go too wide about the those things, that's that why we're here. It's it's a nice idea, but I think that's we wel later in the stage. I've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p yeah, a partial, uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen, so they want the the the normal functions like teletext, volume changing, um uh to be uh, yeah, kinda traditionals uh and uh the the the the other functions, the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen, but to keep this as uh normal as possible, to keep it accessible. Yeah. Yeah, that's true, that's true. Yeah. Yeah, that's true, yeah. Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, that's a good point. Yep. Mm-hmm. They like the fancy stuff, yeah. That's true. Mm-hmm. Mm Yeah. Okay, as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting, this one, are uh are done. Uh I've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind. Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think. Uh so that can be uh can be read out. Uh a f a few things I uh I noticed uh were um Moment. Ooh. Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh we must keep it simple, but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something, so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television, so you must uh the the the the functions, know, like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television. I think that's the point what uh we discussed. Yeah, but you have uh uh an yeah, but you have an international market range, so you have I think a big range of Yeah. Okay. And it's not too complex to do it. Yeah. Just build it in. Yep. Okay. We have five minutes to go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. N yeah. It's very sensitive. Yeah. Okay well uh it's almost at the end. So we have now a lunch break, finally, yeah. Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work, once again uh thirty minutes. Uh I will put my minutes uh I have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too. Thirty minutes, the Failure. Uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email. I don't think I can uh say much about it, so uh uh wait for your email and uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes, and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes. Yeah? Uh well uh thirty minutes. Uh, yeah. Thirty minutes lunch break, yeah. Oh. Forty five? Uh then would it be uh one o'clock. Or we we ask our personal coach. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, uh that was a very uh good session I think, we uh we Uh ye well Yeah, because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh X_D_K_ and that's in No. Well I can I can uh You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work. Deskt Huh. No. Project documents, yeah. Okay, thank you. Uh well, it's it's simply filling oh no, it's uh it's also filling out no, I'd do it after lunch I think. I'm hungry, so do it after lunch. Thank you all. You're welcome. Yeah. Well I bring it to my uh personal room. My executive uh big room with the with the panting.Hi. Yeah, true. Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yes, I can go ahead. Last presentation. Okay. Well, I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions. Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design, technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one, so if you um going to design a remote that looks good, that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make, of course, but also the user friendliness, so tha that's that's some of the main points. And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult, so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote. If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time, 'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see, but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure. And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen, but s I don't know in how far that is possible, since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything, but uh we might uh consider that. Um well, of course I I hope this is all clear to you. If you you can use remote like this with all the functions, many functions, but Well, your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this. You have to be very careful what you push, and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour from uh um yeah well, where is it? Where the hell he here I guess and, yeah, when you have to uh use something else. So just keep it simple, make clear buttons, easy to use. For example if you want to use a play and back and stop, that's very important. Um well this was because of our last discussion, if multiple machines are used, create easy switch between the machines, but um it's no longer uh applying. Well yeah, I prefer to use it only for T_V_ and um n uh not to give too many options and and if possible, uh the buttons should give a dr direct action, not first select Yeah, and so that's where the difficulties lie. Yeah, this so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other. Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original, or uh multi-purpose as we thought, or do we want to use um many buttons. So um weighing those factors. The doesn't. Yeah. Yeah, but when all the questions I had Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_? Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes? 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_, you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay. Uh so that's my recommendation, if you use many options in one buttle button, um display the menu on the T_V_ and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds, is too complicated for most users. Yeah, that will be a problem. Yes. So if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah, the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today, um you should keep it s at this. Use big clear buttons. Not too many. So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options, but I think i this is more important. Um especially the important buttons, um if you want to switch channel, change your volume, uh use teletext, it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote, behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen. And yeah, if you want to uh uh s put on stand-by or change the channel, that should always be possible to do. Not first change menu options or switch something. Um, well yeah, as you already told, give some feedback. If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low. And um, well, my conclusion is uh is uh less is more, keep it simple. So uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know, if there are a lot of function on the the television, some you you'll never know uh and never use, and therefore it's uh important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions. Maybe that's an option. Um keep the primary buttons visible. Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well, put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form. But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen, or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible. Um Yeah. The extra functions, you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions, and you just choose one, and then all all the options will become available and you just c s yeah t scroll through them. Well um then I'd like to make a proposal. If you make one big touch screen, use the same concept as here, keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay, I agree, but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible, so use just for special options a part of the touch screen. And so um an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions, you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah wh Is that possible to use or no? Well, yeah well, does it have to depend on the television? Well, I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match, and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change the settings of the T_V_, like colour and then volume and uh Mm-hmm. Oh, something like that. Well b but make it a separate option in the menu, so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here, so uh parents uh Yeah, you can de display it on the on the old style. You can display actual buttons on the touch screens. Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Well you can use um when you uh how do you call it, s um synchronized, the um remote and the T_V_, then there's always, there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is, from ah, it's a Philips, this and this and that, and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t Well there are universal d um um remotes and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s, uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these. Yeah. Yeah. Well Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh um mo no, you can just say uh the c Yeah. In codes, y you you get a b a book with codes. You look up, I have a Philips H_ fifty five and it says press code four five five and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote and it displays all your uh menu options. Memory in the in the remote. Yeah, well um if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes, there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum. If you have all of them, all the old and new T_V_s summed up, so uh I think uh it is possible. Yeah. Well then you have to buy a new one, it's very good for marketing Maybe, or an update, software update. Firmware update, you say. Yeah. Well, at uh you can go back to the shop and uh they Yeah, ser o and they can download it for you. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well already digital information is sent t to the the standards, T_V_ uh connections, you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels, so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh Receiving. Oh yeah. Yeah. Difficult. Yeah. Yeah yeah, uh s I think some I think it's good idea, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh Um m for which one are we going? My mistake. That one or uh Your vote and your Okay. Well, I was uh doubting about which one to take, but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do. Opens up is too difficult or uh Break it, I don't get Oh so Yeah. Yeah. A quarter to one maybe? Okay. Yeah, is it possible to store this on the share documents or what 'Kay, save it as an image on the res No, and use an image if possible. J_ PEG. J_ PEG. Yeah, it's better Yeah. Oh yeah, it's not connected to the to our P_C_s. It's connected? Yeah. It gives the na Oh. Yes. The questionnaire, fill in uh we fill out d after lunch or uh Okay. Yes. We can leave the P_C_ on I think, yeah and return to the Yeah, bring to I gotta bring it home. A big office. Yes.Hey guys. Too wicked. Okay. 'Kay, welcome. I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level, which I will show you. The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire. Um one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results. Um, these were a couple of findings, first page of three. Um, we have three audiences of two audiences, I'm sorry. Uh the first one, this scale, from sixteen to forty five age. Uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five. Um, as you can see here, the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five. Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent. Mm and some interests from the from the age groups, uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff, like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control, um speech recognition. I don't think that's uh really appropriate. Um, and when you see uh the audience, the age is going up uh Yeah, they don't really want it anymore, at least the new technologies. Second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls. First point is, seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly, uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer. Okay, third findings. According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation, um following buttons are most important. Um, I will tell something about the way this uh this test was, yeah, done. Um, persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most, how much an hour, and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons. Um, when you multiply them, you get the these three points. Switching channels, um yeah, that's pretty uh pretty normal, that's what you do with a remote control. Um the second, teletext, uh and the third, uh volume controls. Um, I think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants, uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay, but uh at the moment uh teletext is Yeah, th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_, like getting information. So uh, when you ask people, what do they use, they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control. That's ridiculous. That's a ne i it It's a new technology, but it's not incorporated right now. Okay, my personal preferences. Um, I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five. Mm, first of all um it's the biggest share, the biggest audience, sixty five percent. Uh second, I think you will get the most revenue from i from it. Um, yeah, people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_, more than uh people who are el uh elder. Um second point, we have to impro improve the most used functions, as I said here, switching channels, teletext and volume controls. Third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire, uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller, so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the, yeah, of the T_V_ where you can put the the remote control in. Um, that's about it, I think. Yeah. Uh not not the r not the functions, but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control. So you can have a remote control full of buttons, a hundreds hundreds of buttons, but if you don't use them, yeah it's Yeah, they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary, but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or Yeah, perhaps. Just for the minor functions perhaps. Just to get less buttons on the remote control, to make it easier and quicker to learn. Yeah? 'Kay, that's it. What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_, connected to the T_V_? So it's in the wrong product. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, maybe another problem uh, I think current T_V_s can even send infrared. Huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen um, that in the middle are the the main keys, like displayed on the Uh yeah.. Yeah, this? No? Yeah. Something like that. Okay, just uh in the middle the general functions, like play, uh channel switching, and then uh at the top or at the bottom, some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down. Mm. Nah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I think so too, but and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus, and when you have a particular menu uh at your device, uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good. Um, because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people. Um, they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up, um and that's a big ad advantage I think, because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something. It's uh very visual intended. What was I to say more? Yeah. Yeah okay, but but if you pick the the idea, the left idea then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen? Yeah, but l like menu functions or Ah okay. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, of course. Yeah, I had another uh idea about maybe parental control. Um, like building in uh some kind of PIN code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels, uh but children uh if children don't don't know the PIN code, they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or Th there's just Ju just a simple log-in, something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, th that kind of stuff, but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um, you address the the channels and like uh oh, that's channel fifteen, that's uh vi violent channel, uh m my ki my kids uh I don't want my kids to watch that, then you set the priority to only parents, for example. But Yeah okay, but but yeah, that's just that's an a an added feature. Yeah, th th those things are nice. Partial. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers that's just as e just as easy. Yeah. Yeah, it's different. Yeah, age b below forty. And th those young people, yeah. Y you saw it in my marketing report, they like the new fancy stuff, so A touch screen, like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications. I th I think we can do that too. Done. Yeah, yeah, some of them. The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s, so you have to display it on one uh T_V_. Yeah, but that's not possible. Mm-hmm, mm yeah. Add th that that's an opportunity. Yeah. But No. No no no. He he he he me he means just just one other thing. Uh, with the current remote controls, the universal ones, um you have to press yeah, you have to press a code for T_V_. Yeah. Yeah. Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options, in just just in the memory, so that if you yeah, like profile, so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh the memory uh pops up the options. I th don't think that's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But, on the other hand on the other hand, uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote New remote? A firmware upgrade or something, but from where? Ah. Maybe w No m may no, maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection, so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet. Yeah, like a s kind of service centre. Yeah. Yeah. I I think it's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop. It's it's it's not a lot of work, just one uh docking station where you put it in, press start, bling bling, updated. Yeah. You don't buy a T_V_ every week, new teev so. Let's vote. My vote too. And your vote? Yeah. And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open. Uh too difficult, um maybe uh it's easier to break it. Yeah, th th th that i uh Yeah. Like my telephone, it's uh it's sensitive too. Ah. Thirty minutes? How minutes? One question, uh how late do we have to get back be back here? Thirty minutes lunch break? I thought forty five. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Save as. Yeah, v But but you can open a from your pr from your laptop. Yeah, maybe. Save as. No. Export. Export H_T_M_L_. Huh, image? Paper size A_ four. Uh screen size. In this directory. No? Yeah, it is connected. Yeah, I think so. Oh. Thank you. Yeah, of course. To my exave executive Aye. Yeah. Okay.Hi. I see my bunny is still standing. No one drawing it. Uh I figured uh that much. When you mentioned uh improving functions, what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about? Uh, the funtionability. Ah okay, so focusing more on the used buttons. Yeah. Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions, like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example. Thank you. Yeah, ma perhaps, just just an idea. Yeah. Uh yeah yeah, I'll go, sure. Right uh, I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project. Well uh what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked, how they worked, uh what kind of components are involved, and how they are connected together. And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds. And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off. Um right. Uh well what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared, not like all probably know. And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something, and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared, so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate, so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us. So that's probably why most controls are still infrared. Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure, so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote. Well uh as I mentioned ready, we have some Bluetooth Well it may be possible, but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget, but that's not for me to decide, but that's maybe something for marketing to look into. F because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth or or radio waves, although Yeah, actually I have t Yeah. Yeah, I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice, but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function. So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem, but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder, is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote. If somebody says, where is the remote, then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something, I dunno, maybe uh maybe something to look into, I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be. But it may be uh may be something to explore. Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components. Uh first you have the energy source. The energy source would be a battery, simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere. I figured that would be best, 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one. So we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that. Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button, but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch there is a switch uh between these. When the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button, when a button is prush pushed in, uh a electric current goes through here, and in uh immediately, a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened. That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking, well uh did the button be pressed, w what happened uh. Or I press button but nothing's happening on the T_V_, so is is something wrong or something. So that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user. Uh w well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end. And those uh interpreted by the device, well in this case the television. Uh well my personal preferences here, well we have to keep it simple. Not too many uh gadgets and functions, just like you said uh well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use you don't use them, so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those. Uh I I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving. So uh no input from the television. So I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that, because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too, and so in order to receive the signals from uh what's on T_V_ and such. So I figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and Yes, but what should we uh s I I I f I agree with you, but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control? 'Cause that would be I mean extra components, extra designs, um larger g uh remote control. These all uh all stuff that we have to take in account. So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all. Um, well we should uh look into the design and the functionability. Like I said, uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions, or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something, the usual uh stuff. And uh don't overbuild, we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions, but we we should stick to the basics. So that was my uh my personal opinion. And that was my uh my presentation uh Yeah, but Yeah. Yeah, but Yeah, but Well you d you have to keep in mind that uh several T_V_s uh don't even have a menu structure, or they have a very simple menu structure, so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions. And that would be uh a considerable problem. Yeah. Not embed Yeah, but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something. Yeah. Yeah. The extra functions. Yeah. Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen, uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet and uh I'll just make um uh let's say fifteen buttons on it, and uh we have three of those, uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus, with or sub-items, sub-functions. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, like like the iPod idea that that we just saw. You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus, and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on. Uh uh I think that will be great. Yeah, I wou I would actually go for the Yeah. That is possible, that well that actually depends on the television, but I think I figure that would be Well, y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote, you you set the uh channels, the the channels are different on each te television, they aren't set in a preset order, so uh if you uh lock on a remote, uh let's say channel fifteen, well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television, so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that would b Yeah, that. Uh. I I do Uh I do agree, because well, it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button, but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience. W we are aiming for younger people and they they chose So that's that's probably uh a But they Well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ and that that is bit of a tricky job. I actually use one of those when They are they are kinda kinda troublesome, but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes, because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_, like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive, and that's well Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Oh, okay, yeah, sure, uh Yeah yeah yeah. Oh, yeah yeah, sure, that would be possible, yeah. Profiles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that would be possible. Yeah, sure. No, that wouldn't be uh Yeah, a few variables. Yeah. Ah it is. It is definitely po Yeah, firmware upgrade. That's maybe the cup holder. Yeah. Well, not everybody has uh has uh a P_C_ at home. Well the most most people have, but not not everybody and Yeah. Yeah, maybe something like service cen Or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier, and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection. Yeah. Well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in, we could actually look at into it, but I dunno, it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it and Yeah, that would be probably best, yeah. Like when you when you buy a T_V_ you just ask well I'll Yeah. Yeah, that would be best, yeah. No no. Exactly, so Yeah, my vote goes out to the right. Flips open. Export. Maybe not export function. G_ yeah, J_ PEG. N oh. To room. I'll just uh saved in my documents. Yeah in my own uh in my own messenger. Yeah. Okay, nice.

When this functional design meeting opens the project manager tells  the group about the project restrictions he received from management by email. The marketing expert is first to present, summarizing user requirements data from a questionaire given to 100 respondents. The marketing expert explains various user preferences and complaints about remotes as well as different interests among age groups. He prefers that they aim users from ages 16-45, improve the most-used functions, and make a placeholder for the remote. The industrial designer begins explaining the working design. He talks about existing products, most of which use infared since it is simple and cost-effective. He suggests adding a speech function, when someone asks where the remote is and it beeps. He also explains the various components, materials, and energy sources of a remote, giving preference to a remote with multifunctional buttons and without a receiver. The interface specialist presents, talking about the possible components of the remote and concluding that the remote should be simple and accessible without too much functionality. The group continues the meeting by having discussion about the possibility of a touch screen, LCD, and other functions. The group closes the meeting and goes to lunch. 
7	Hello. Um, Project Manager, I have something to tell you. I have a little problems with my laptop. And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete. No, a little problem, uh big problem. I just thought Um, it didn't work anymore. The entire Windows uh It it hung. During lunch, yeah. He's the master, yeah. Wow. Oh, have you considered the option of using a solar panel? W nah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Th th yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah. Um, I think you should use kinetic as a back-up. A combination, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Psycho-kinetic. Yeah. Buy a fifty cents battery and uh Well maybe I have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that. Um, isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a. Or do you think it Rubber casing, yeah. Yeah. Um, well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have. Uh, is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square? It isn't, I think, yeah? We're We put fashion in electronics, so maybe we can uh Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. Okay, I I get it. Okay. That's good. Well, as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm, and you don't uh it's not bendable or something, I th I think that goes too far. Oh. Okay. It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor. Okay. Do your thing. Spongeball. It'll float. Tables. Ah. Hey. Twelve fifty uh When your parents are watching some boring program, you can take the remote and do something else. Take it. Ooh. S Mm-hmm. In Okay. Um the interface contents. Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there. But, the main concept is um take one big touch screen. Um, always display the primary buttons clear and visible. Maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space. And uh make the menu structure changeable. So if you press um system, that's Yeah, well m multiple system options can, maybe five or ten or or one, can fit in. Or maybe even a step further when you want to um t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button. And um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary. And um well, how do uh do we want to look at uh uh f um Yeah Does a remote look Well, it's you've gotta hold it in one hand. So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small, so you can put it in inside your hands. And some remotes you can use with your thumb. But I think that's too difficult for this one. So you can make it s a little broader. Yeah. And here? And maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons. And use your other hands on the menu structure. So here are gonna be the program buttons. One, two, three, four, et cetera. And the the volume control and program control maybe. And, down here, um, I added, this could be one uh big L_C_D_. Um, the menu structure. So you can use it in uh in this way. Um One thing you've gotta keep in mind, keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time. Um, know that if you are changing the menu structure here, um And well, I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons. But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_, do not display twenty other options that are possible. Just keep it as simple as uh as possible. And do not use too many levels. Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus, and um push plus twenty times. But just the um uh just in one button if possible. And um, well, you kn you all know the T_V_ levels. Um, channel one, two. And when you get to n to uh to ten, ye and want to go back, uh well you have a problem. Just m most most modern T_V_s, you you press one zero, and it goes to ten. And else, to one and through after that. So the s a button less. And um, things like teletext, put them in the menu. Things like um um Yeah. Yeah, yeah w Yeah, I I find I must trying to uh tell it. Is uh volume plus and minus? And this is program uh plus and minus. Uh Yes. Or if you're watching Studio Sports on uh on seventeen, and your wife is watching some soap on two Well yes, I think that's a good idea. But um, well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure. And if you're using that button a lot of times, well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen. You just don't have to play games uh in-between. But if you're really switching between two channels, you won't have time uh to d use the other options. Um, yeah already already told that. Yeah. That's my conclusion. Well, I agree, just put it in the menu structure somewhere. Um, yeah um system properties, um parental control. Yeah. Mm. Um, w well, yeah. It it has to be fast. You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings. Mm-hmm. Why Mm-hmm. You c may use like when there's uh X_P_, uh a simple log-on, d you just push uh one or two or three. And if you push parents, then Yeah. To log in. Yeah. And if you puts a ye Uh-huh. And if you w you push p children, uh you don't have to uh log in, but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh Okay. Well Yeah. Well, maybe um some idea on that. Just make through a remote as it is, but make an option to insert profiles, 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote, he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do. Just make it an option in menu, ins install powerful profiles or something. Um, b well, still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones. You're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see, but well, I I when I think, oh yeah, for the f for all the standard channels, and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels, because if you're watching uh, I don't know, you're in the at day uh, cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night. I don't know. Yeah, the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all, will have to decide uh That isn't possible. Well, yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then, but Mm-hmm. Yeah, on a separate menu uh option. Yeah, well yeah, I A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition. But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh, hearing loud noises from the T_V_, someone screaming one, and you f the channel switches, uh Yeah. Yeah. W you can put it on chip anyway, so uh As long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote, but uh Optional in But how we do it? Well, I think also it's a good idea, buts very difficult to incorporate. So we should make it too complex. Is t some menu uh function, you choose parental control, and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on. But uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem. Mm-hmm. Well Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option. You can put on Yeah. And you can just uh s when you buy it, you can select um personal preference, parental control on, and the password or something. Oh, it's a p Yeah. Well, maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs, where the parent says, you cannot watch channel seven, nine, and ten, and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock. And there's just some little uh clock in the remote. No, no, it's very simple. There uh th I h I've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it. So, the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's To put it very blunt, that's not our problem. Just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh It's not not a part of the remote. You have to f Yeah. Uh, or make it ourselves very diffic Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Oh. Yeah? I'm listening. Um, well What I was thinking about is just a menu structure, when you don't use it is simple. And when you push uh system properties, uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program. Som some bench-marker. Oh. Uh, logo. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds, they'll still remember it. And it it l linger on every time you see it. Very annoying. Yeah. Yeah, I It's ok For f Oh, for the next meeting, right? Um Stay here and P_. Ah, no new email. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah. Uh-huh. See you. Yeah. Here? Or uh Yeah. If you got a No. So Stupid manager. No. Don't get what'sHey, Project Manager. What was it, problem? The laptop? It hang hung. Ha-ha. Oh. Project Manager. You're our Project Manager. Master. Master of I'm sorry. Okay. Go on. Yeah but when the power gets low, you have to shake it or something? Uh, and uh uh Hmm. Mm yeah. It's too less space. And when the battery doesn't work, I usually shake it too. So Like slamming on it. It's exactly the same. Hmm. But, are you going to draw it? The Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I c I can't imagine. I can't imagine how how how it looks like. Yeah. Design. Mm-hmm. Uh Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Well, I think uh we're going to sell tell ten millions of them. So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan, like uh Samsung, can give us uh a big discount on the chips, so U usually, chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar. So That that shouldn't be a real issue, I think. Yeah, a combination. Yeah. Like an uh aku uh Acu uh, yeah. Well,. Yeah. Combine them. Okay. Of course. Fifty cent. Rubber. Rather hard. Yeah. Well, I think that touch-screens are generally square. But it's the case you put around it that makes the shape. Hmm? Yeah okay, but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen, and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen. That That's it's custom customisable and Yeah, me too. Mm yeah. Yeah. Can I uh do my thing? It uh Expert map. Okay uh Last week I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching. For marketing. Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan. In Paris and Milan, we uh asked different people, uh differing in age and in income, uh the amount of money to spend, um what they like in design uh and material nowadays. Findings. Our main audience, uh so that's people below forty, uh prefer the following. At first, the colours of fruit. Very basic colours, like Janus explained. Um, fresh colours, uh green, red, uh strawberry red, uh yellow, banana yellow. Um, considering material, um Yeah. They like spongy material, like yeah a sponge-ball. Like a s soft material. Janus m uh mentioned it also. I think he did some uh some findings himself. You wer you weren't in Paris? Okay. Like this. Like big uh g flashy colours. Fresh. It's nice, I think. Okay, our secondary audience, uh people above forty a forty years in age, they like the dark traditional colours. Uh Yeah, uh materials like wood that No n j just j just a w No, okay, but just just a wooden uh look. Like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor. The that isn't wood anyway, but Okay? But, that's our secondary audience. So, uh we decided to take mm yeah the people below forty. So, that this doesn't apply. 'Kay, the third. Uh, there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls. They have to look fancy. Um, they should be technological in innovative. That means uh there have to be fancy things in. Uh, and easy to use. But that's common. My personal preferences. We have to aim at a mu at the main audience. And uh, therefore use fresh colours. Uh, I'll I'll come to that in a second point. Here, think about removable covers, as seen in mobile telephon telephone market. To customise your own remote control. Like the Nokia uh the removable covers, uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one. Uh, a third, material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber. Um, two advantages. Uh, it fits within the current market trends. And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it. So Uh to come back to your question, I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard. Like uh seen on regular mobile phones. Actually, they have a lot in common. The phones and the Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, exactly. Uh, in my second sheet of personal preferences, uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition. Uh, it's very innovative. Innovative. Yeah, like something. You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies, like speak uh speech recognition and stuff. But, we have to keep the cost in uh in mind, but it Yeah, it it can be uh very expensive. 'Kay, second. Uh, building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users. Uh, also the link with uh mobile phones. Uh No, but No, okay. But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call. It's just the same. Yeah. When you're at college. Uh No. You al you also take uh t you take your IPac and go uh play games. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I do that, but Okay, and um And third, I stick with it, the log-in functionality uh with the slogan, take parental control to a new dimension. That's it. Yeah. Uh, what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button? L like in uh internet explorer. Yeah okay, but does it that is for uh going from four to five. But if you go from two to eight, and you want Yeah, and on two. That you can switch switch easy. Yeah it is. Yeah. Mm no. That's it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah but What I see uh How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents, children. Something like that. And w when you want to use the parents uh option, you have to Yeah, ok Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Pu push parents. That then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in. Like two one three. And it's in. It automatically goes Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. V violent T_V_. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah, w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store, it has to be just simple and plain. But if you want to install it personally uh If I got kids, and I could choose between uh two remote controls. One uh w with parent control and one without, and I would would buy the one with. I th Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but yeah but that isn't possible. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, and And and you know w uh when you install another device, uh children can still go up to the T_V_, p pop open uh the thing and and and g go to a channel. Yeah, yeah of course. But Yeah. Ah it's Yeah. Yeah, okay. But it's just an an added feature feature. Mm yeah. Yeah, like f voice recognition is too much, I think. But games. It doesn't Yeah. That that doesn't c that doesn't co Yeah, that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources, I think. Yeah, it's it's in it. But too ma I I think so, but Yeah. To put Yeah, to put it in always. Yeah, but T_V_s aren't capable of sending. Yeah? I thought they were just a able to receive. Yeah, some. But Yeah. Yeah, j just some rules. Yeah, okay. But, on the T_V_ at least my T_V_, is a is a compartment which you can press. And there are buttons uh behind it which you can use, if you d if you don't if you don't have a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Or j Yeah. Ah I have to uh consult my legal advisor about it. Consensus. Oh. Oh. I I have one thing left. Maybe for uh Jerome. Um, the views. Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view. Yeah. Like at In the experts view, you have a lot of more buttons. Yeah. Mm yeah, okay. Fairly enough. Yeah. Yeah, wh which buttons you like or not. Yeah. Yeah. Just leave the other numbers away. Okay. Go on. A little chat. Marketing. Management. Yeah, that's my function, to Okay. Go on. How I know a marketing name for our product. R_ th R_ to the third power. R_ three. Real Reaction remote. Mm-hmm? Bling. Yeah. Yeah, okay, but it has to be like a split second, because you have to put in a code also and Yeah. Yeah. That spins around like all the time. It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer. Okay. Who uh Who who gave you the master class? Ronald Betenberg? Okay, thanks. Ah. In the master class. Yeah. Me too. Thank you too, lord. 'Kay guys, lot of success.Hi. Yeah, sure. Okay. Uh, let me see. I think it's this one. Ha. Right. Uh, well, I'll be talking about the components. Uh, what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups. Uh below forty five and above. And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh, well, what what d do we want, and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group. Well uh what I found was that a senior um senior citizens uh Ye Ah, it's it's okay. Uh They, well, they like more the they like the traditional materials, like wood and and such more. Wood and chrome. And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes. Um, uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles, where whereas the young and dynamic, they like a more uh soft materials. Think of the Teletubbies, for instance. Uh uh, soft and fluffy and colourful and Well uh, shapes are curved and round. Y y you get the picture. And uh they like sports and gaming, and that gives them uh the vitality. Uh, so w well uh, firs Yes. Yeah. No, I'll I'll get to that. You you'll see. Yeah. Uh, well f first off, let's start start with the energy. W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources. But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic. Uh kinetic, that's when you move something, then uh it gets energy. I figured, well that's ki kinda high-tech, when when you have a remote control that well, when you pick it up, it has power. That would be actually very nice, uh I figured. Well, we could also use a battery, that's a bit Yeah. Yeah yeah, you c just you have to shake it around a little bit. And then then it d then it has some more uh energy. Well, y you could just go for a battery. Or you can go for both? Yeah, I actually did. But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light. Well, sunlight preferably. Uh, and you you could you could use normal light, but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something. Uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels, you could actually use uh you could use uh solar panels, but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control, leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface. So uh so i i it it wo what's actually I I c just in f I've figured it out that well, uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of T_V_, and the from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light. So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_. But, well you just take up all the space, and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used. So I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well, the costs aren't that much higher, and um, ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery. I mean, if No, but uh d Well, you pick it up and you press buttons and y well, you Yeah, well uh actually it is. And it it if it isn't, you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again. But, what l what Jarek said, you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves. And for rest, you'd just add juice on the battery. Exactly. And so that Uh Uh well, f furthermore, you you we uh checked uh the cases. We have uh different options uh concerning the cases. You ha I you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh I figured that's a bit boring. So you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved. Um, single curve, it's just a well, uh, you know, it's just uh a nice curve. Or but but you could go in a in an double curves. And that's like several different dimensions. That gives you an whole new uh effec Yeah, that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look, I f I figured. But, that uh we'll discuss later. What? You want me to draw in three-D_? Uh, yeah, I ca I ca I could I could show you. I could show you. Well uh let's say y uh you uh Let's say that's your standard uh That's a bit your d standard design. But you could actually go like uh something like this. And then uh in three-D_ effect you could go So y you you just Yeah, this is a this bit uh difficulty in I didn't take a major in art. So But but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth, you could you could uh just play around a bit with. You you don't have to use standard uh Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity. Uh that might be an idea, but just a Well, furthermore, uh well, uh plastic versus rubber? You We could choose uh what uh what's better, plastic um or rubber. I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh Yeah. Yeah, it's soft and it's that I like soft. Yeah, yeah I mean uh plastic uh is Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it, like plastic uh Your your I usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap. Uh that's maybe just me, but Uh, we could uh uh, oh, talk about it later. Uh furthermore, buttons. Uh traditional uh or a touch screen. Well, we discussed it in a previous meeting, so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_. And uh chip set, well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons, we could go uh with a simple chip set. But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L_C_D_ screen, we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set. And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it. So that's something we th have to keep in mind. If it isn't uh manageable uh budget-wise, we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons. Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah, probably, but But uh yeah, that's that's That shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue. I'll I'll I'll just add, uh uh I put a big summary here, so we could discuss it a bit. Uh what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic? Yeah, you you you should we should A combination. Uh, you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. When you pick it up, it charges up. Yeah. Yeah yeah, I know. Yeah, I con Exactly. What uh what do you think? You agree? Yeah? Both? Okay. Uh, well that would bring the m m some more costs, but I mean the Who cares, right. That's the Project Manager's problem. Yeah, well Fifty cent uh Uh, why doesn't And then we have single-curved versus double-curved. That Okay. No, we'll we'll just wait and uh Uh, plastic versus rubber. Any ideas? Uh, rubber? You Uh, I figured it will be m rather than hard Nah, rubber c uh this is a casing, yeah. Rubber casing, because well if you use an uh d a touch-screen, uh it's just a casing uh around it. So um, you could go for plastic, but I figured I I I would choose rubber. Well, m I don't know. No. Yeah. That isn't Yeah, that would cover it. That that would solve the problem. So mm Uh uh so uh so what are the opinions? Uh rubber or plastic? I I I prefer rubber. Yeah, you too? You sure? You you you seemed to hesitate a bit. Yeah, it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh No, that that that that's gonna The the chip set will hold it firm in place, and uh and and uh and a L_C_D_ screen also Yeah it m might it might. Uh, tra uh traditional versus L_C_D_, well I figured we we all set on that. And uh, then also the simple versus advanced. Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_, we we should have the advanced. So that shouldn't be a problem. Okay, well that's my uh Uh, you're welcome. Well, the Teletubbies sh Well, you could. You you could. Well uh Yeah. Well, I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote, so Yeah. Hey. That might be a next step. Well, yeah. You take your uh remote with you to school. Yeah. Very nice. I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it. Because well it's a simple function, but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it. Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such. And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it. I don't know what But, well, if you want to I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control, uh let's say we do, and and well whatever, cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance. Well uh, nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel. But that Well, I'm not sure because um for that to happen, you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control, so it would, yeah, have to be constant uh constant signalling. What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control. And that uh provides parental control, for instance. And that's just an optional uh device. So there's n that's there's uh besides uh the remote control, you'll have a separate uh Yeah? Yeah, that's true. That's true, but uh at same instant, same happens when uh you have remote control. So But, only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control, and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it. So, you you'd be Yeah. Yeah. I can see games happening. Yeah. Yeah, that will be nice. Well, I don't know. I I figure if you had two different remotes, you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it. So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control. But it would would be uh more expensive. So, a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model. Could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model, uh for instance. Yes they are. Yeah. Yeah, you you have some T_V_s any Yeah. That is true, that is true. Well yeah, you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control. But you still have the problem about uh the television itself. Yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that is true. Yeah, that is true. Yeah, you could you could you could go like uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy. You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem. Yeah, I figured I figure we could do that. Yeah, yeah, sure. Uh, I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it, but User profile. Well yeah, you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself, for the more advanced users. Yeah, which buttons do you want to in it. Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button, and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels. Yeah, you could you could m have people want uh want that. Ah, yeah, sure. Well, if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen, you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom. And it could just stay there. Yeah, that spins around or something. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, something like that. A small icon. So we're going to work together right now? Definitely. Well thank you too. You wish. M Aye? Cheers. Hey. Yeah, uh I'm not sure if we uh we Because I saw something about individual actions. Well, yeah. Right. Uh Do you have new email? Hmm.Hello again. Mm yeah. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes. Your project manager. Welcome to the conceptual design meeting for Real Reaction. Uh, hello again. Uh it's uh the same as the last time. Uh uh, also this time there will be uh three presentations. And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts. Um uh, and at the end, uh I uh, when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh visited. information. The the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on. Um uh, our from uh are of two sorts. Components concepts and user interface concepts. Uh, the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh Well, we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable. Uh how how about the energy? Can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange? Uh, the user interface concept. Uh, with the type and uh the the supplements. So uh where to put what button. And uh uh I would say uh Jans, can you begin? Okay. At the end, uh I will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder. Mm-hmm. One one little question. Um about the the material. Uh a soft material for a remote control? Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Oh. But you prefer kinetic? Okay. Yeah, but you don't move a a remote control too much. And that's enough to to keep the energy level uh Okay. Okay. Thank you, Tim. Yeah. Dynamic dynamic look? A little artistic. Okay. It's soft. That's the material the younger people want uh, ain't it? Just like the watch from Seiko. Yeah. I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too. Yeah. Combine them. Rubber. Yeah. Yeah. Mm yeah. Me too. Yeah? Okay. Mm yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Do your thing, Tim. Bring it on. Yeah. Flashy. Yeah. Yeah, but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of. Yeah but never seen one. Case. Oh, a wooden look, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Maybe you could use your remote as a phone. There are numbers on it, so uh So that you say um S_P_S_S_, and it goes to uh Okay. Yeah, but you don't use that th games when you watching television, I think. Yeah, okay. You take your remote control with you. Uh great. Oh, okay. Uh I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with. The parental control, the games, and the voice recognition. Uh There's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote. I don't know how you think about it. Yeah. Yeah. No but I think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television, and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer, so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it, because uh you Yeah, you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff, and you heard on the news that uh that he Yeah, they believe that children uh are influenced by the television, and uh Well, we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years. But there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. That's a that's a better idea? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, with and one without. Yeah. Yeah, maybe it can work with show view. Uh, you you can control your video recorder with show view. Uh, when you tick in a number, it will uh start and end uh recording. But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent, and that they are blocked out. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't put it in an optional device. That that then then then it becomes too much, I think. If we do it, we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile, a parent profile, and a family profile, and otherwise. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition? I personally think that that becomes too much. It's more like it gets you to the functionality, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And games? That would Okay. So that will uh that that that must be in it, you think? Okay. So the games uh are in it. The voice recognition are not. And the parental control are optional? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. Uh, but uh will there uh uh Like the first idea uh from uh You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh Yeah? Mm yeah. Yeah, you yo Yeah, but most often not. Yeah. Okay. So uh I think we have decided on the things that Uh from Janus, the energy, the combination between battery and kinetic. The case will be double-curved and uh rubber, in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable. The buttons will be uh touch-screen. Uh but there may not be too many buttons. And in the the menu structure, uh there must not to be uh Five minutes to go. Uh, too uh too many levels. And uh it must be easy to use. The parental control will be incorporated, but it must be not too complex. And the games are in it. So I think we have uh we have decided uh, okay. Uh, little more. Yeah. Like a like a moat or s or something. Yeah. Yeah, but you have that in the Yeah. You use the Yeah. It's already incorporated a little in that concept. Okay. We take it to the other meeting, okay? I have a little w uh little chat to do and uh then we uh finish. I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us. First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management. Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge, uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that. It's it's uh very hot at the moment, so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh marketing or did I said management? Oh. Just talking about myself. Uh W What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote, just some uh Yeah. Import export. And uh another one. Uh, they're a ha they're at Yeah, benchmarking, that's the word I saw. I uh couldn't uh Okay, uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey, and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider, instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us. So, we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company, uh a trustful company, and uh it has m Okay. I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing. When you uh put on remote, you see a kind of a just like when you telephone, you see a little uh animation. Real Reaction remote. And uh with the with the with the motto, we put fashion in electronics. And then you go uh The Yeah. But w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own. Mm yep, yeah. Also also. But we we are uh Yeah yeah y yeah yeah. Okay, but uh think about that kind of things. That's what they said in the master class.. N Uh, next meeting starts in thirty minutes. So uh maybe you can go to Paris and Milan uh once again. The master class? Franz Mehler's. Uh, very special, uh next uh session. Uh idea that you uh the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype. And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard. So that's a kinda new uh thing. And um, the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation. But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email. Yeah, the well, uh dids this what I uh what I heard. I Not in the master class. So you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh But I think it was a very uh very good uh session, uh gentlemen. I will thank you all. And uh Give me a good evaluation. Cheers. See you in a half hour. But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh Yeah, but th there's there's still the my uh instructions that you will work together. That's not my problem. Bye-bye.

The project manager went over the agenda. The industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source, materials and components. He recommended using kinetic energy, and having a double-curved rubber case. The group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy. The marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material. He explained that the remote should look fancy, and be technologically innovative and easy to use. He suggested using removable customisable covers, speech recognition, installing some games into the remote, and implementing a parental control feature. The user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons. Most features will be controlled through the menu. The group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition. After a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature. The project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management. The group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote, including having an animated logo on the touch screen. The project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting. 
8	So is Why not save that. Do you want to replace existing file, no. I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents, but spreadsheet. Yeah, but I've ta uh right, I'll just re-do it. That's the easiest way. Right. R right. Um, all these things have cost implications. And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button. So However, I've now. But um, yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that, and uh as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours, would be uh open to debate, I suppose. An important consideration. Right, okay so um And the second one underneath would be the idea for the Right, okay. So we've got um detail design meeting. Right. So So, we've got prototype presentation, which we've just done, evaluation criteria, um and finance, so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting. So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer, but um obviously obviously it would. But other than that, we got the red apple. We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons, and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance. And the and the cost implication. The only snag about this is that uh the cost is probably kind of important. So um, and then the production evaluation, as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture. Um, and whether it would uh Right, so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half Euros. So, there's no redesign. So that should uh Right, so, seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that uh Right. Okay. Right.. Okay, so, by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements. So, we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and Okay. W the button supplements. Well, originally, I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple. But So the so the real w the real question then would come in. Do you make all the buttons O Well, so we've got one special button form, which was the apple. Everything else is gonna be a standard. We've got special material, rubber, wood, titanium, et cetera and that, so, I was originally, I was thinking rubber wasn't special, but according to this, maybe it is. So And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there. W I don't know is is is the sort of answer, is that meant to be all sixteen buttons, and therefore I mean, what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons, but just to have the one that was soft and spongy, and therefore Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber, whereas the rest would be hard plastic. Mm. I would Every design change is uh I dunno, um Okay, um, if we just had all the buttons as standard, except for the one red apple, then that would take care of that, I guess. We'd have one special colour and one special button form. And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half. As far as I know, that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements. And if What happened? Now, right. Okay, so, but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special Sorry, you were saying that it would be that one, that you would put in one there. Okay. So it Well, is it s is no, it's nine point seven I've got. Okay. So, that would that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons, then that would be fine. And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on. Uh-huh. Well, hold on. Um, if we Okay, that gives us twelve point seven But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the Oh, I see, so just take out the special colour for the apple and And go for battery instead. That would give you one less. But you reckon that i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries. Mm-hmm. But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options? In a sense, at the moment, we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two. At least. Remember that was a minimum requirement. The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful, would be to um make it originally, we're gonna make it a simple product. Mm-hmm. Makes sense.. Sorry, do you want that back up? Right. Okay, but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost. Go for one. Yep. Okay. Yeah, why not not, m m maybe nearer three. Two three. Well, it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down, we've got solar power, we've got uh various other things you could have, and we're not going for these options. Mm-hmm. Okay. No. 'Cause you can't afford that w we took that out too. Didn't you? Or Well, wait a minute. In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic. The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five. And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic. So, it's very much dependant on what you do with your options. And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker, then because that the other functions we've got in are are more at the The special material, the rubber, wood, titanium, et cetera, if you go for that, th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six, whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two. Now you're trying to lose one point two, so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker, you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else. And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery, to have your uh sample sensor speaker, and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two, which would be come from the button supplements category. Um, interface type um, well plastic rather than rubber. That that that would make the significant difference. You could either you could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber, then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then, you could keep your sample sensor, and you'd be looking to take out point two. So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom, or your special colour at the bottom. And that would enable you to to do it. Yeah. Ye Well, okay, but It's rubber as it is, yes. We got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically, we're going to reduce down from that. But the current one, you'd say would be fancy, would be too Mm-hmm. I would've said about a two as well. Oh. The next on Well, I can just sing about. Easy to use. I would've said yes. I would go for a one on that at this point in time. Um, incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer. Well, yeah it certainly has some.. Yep. I don't know. Yep. Yeah, I woulda said two would seem reasonable. The product is a recognisable real r uh reaction product? Oh. S Okay. So we're going for a two, three? Sure. Right, okay. Two. Right, come on. That's that decided. Right. So So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements, and then About a two. Two. Yep. Two b two b two, yeah. Yes. Well, you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements. Okay, well I put it back on. Yes, I would've thought so. Okay, so what was it, control uh F_ eight, wasn't it? Oh. Oh. How kind. Right, okay. So, you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic, right, you've got a choice there of going down to battery, which would save you one. You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker, which is your big item. That's right. Which gets you Yes. Alright. Okay, so So we're going for plastic, yes? Yep. Well, uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them. You got special colour. Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple, and therefore, that was the special colour. Well, we've got special form. Now that would be one button, and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button. 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special So so no matter how you look at that, that would be the same. The other thing would then be special material, rubber, wood, titanium. Alright. So, special colour, you want three in there. Okay. That makes sense. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I would agree with that, I think. So special colours, two. And we've got special form is the one apple. The rest are all standard, although you could argue that should maybe be You were making these buttons down the bottom, I was presuming, bigger than the other ones, or were you? Was that the idea? Uh-huh. I would have thought that's probably about r well. Right. Yep, that makes sense. Yep. I woulda said so. Yeah. So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two. Real Reaction produ I'm not quite sure, what does that mean? Yep I would s You mean of Well you could argue you might do it once a year, you would change, because at the moment you're making a red apple. So next year you could make next year's model the same, but have it as a a yeah whate whatever, a lemon. Yeah, l a lemon lemon or something. And that amount Yeah, we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it? We've Well, ease has certainly stayed. Yeah. And the speech feature. How it would play out, yeah. Oh. Well, but you've got the company logo on there, which would effectively be a stick-on badge. So you're in a sense, you're comparing the product without the company logo. And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on. Don't think so. But but i but in the sense that, as you saw with um the Windows logo badge, it doesn't really matter. There's virtually n The way that you frame, you know, the Windows badge on there, it really doesn't matter what colour it is, so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline. Fact, they've got black and white or black and silver. So basically, even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display, because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo, it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product. And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it. You could put in another Well, in this one, you've actually got three colours of buttons. Well, we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour. So you were talking about uh um We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel, the hidden away panel, would all be standard. Which m may or may not be the case. Well, yeah. Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know, on the second page, as it were, that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour? Yeah, well Alright. Okay. So we just add that to profitability in effect. Right, so we're meant to finish up in five minutes. Mm-hmm. So we're okay this way around. Until the design team comes in and says, get off. But you are the design team. So what bit are we on to? Yeah. I th I th Oh. Right, okay. Oh drats, I've botched that, haven't I. Right, okay um What's happened here? Right, okay um Mm. Right, okay um, Right. So we got So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign. So we're now on to project process. Now satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means, et cetera, whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera. So, we're actually now uh, in a sense, on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it. So what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain. So, um So I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down, which I will do. So, uh I think I have to finish that page. Right, okay, so Project evaluation. So, um Creativity. Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough? Well um Individual meetings. How do you mean? In you on your own. Um Mm, The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process, you would normally, you go to a meeting, you decide, right, you do this, you do that, you do that. Then you go away. You find out information. You then come back. You then discuss it. You then go and change things around, and then go back. So Whereas, this time, you're really getting it from a database source, so it's not uh well uh Anyway, so, what do you want to put down? I've put, seemed okay. Creativity, seemed okay. Um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed. Um Have could have used a different example pel to increase create Creativity. You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing, so I th I uh d But the other thing is that uh they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project. I mean, m my wife at the moment, for instance, is uh acting as a computer um for um you normally, you got a problem, so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed. So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question. And then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction, show them where to either give them directly give them help, or secondly, point them in the right direction, either at the library, or uh or or come back, or go and see Joe Bloggs, or whatever. So uh, and that was a project I suspect similar to this, because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work. And of course, you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong. So Alright, so we've got uh New ideas found, did we find any, no. Alright. Leadership, teamwork. Does You've got voice recognition computers, that's not remote controls. Mm-hmm. Okay, so how do you reckon teamwork went? To uh go uh reasonably well. Okay. Bit bit arbitrary. Mm-hmm. So, we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means, E_ G_ whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera. And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing. Now, I'd much rather be in marketing but I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked. However, um Alright uh means, so whiteboard um so really, it's uh equipment. Oh. Right. New ideas found, so one or two. um and uh voice uh, was it voice activated um recognition. Right, so, uh are the costs within budget, yes. Is the project evaluated, yes. Uh, don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary. Then celebration. Yeah. Uh, so we don't re So really I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three, and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere. Mind you, the the figure last was was different, but it should be possWe also have a apple slash cherry design at the top. Yeah, yeah, we might get a For the M_. They're thinking For the first time, well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons. Hum, you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons, so you've got the volume in orange on design there, and the the channel is in blue. Yeah, sis Yes, we'll have the slide-away. Bottom. Mm-hmm. Yes, yes. Okay. Mm-hmm. This this is a yes, this is our presentation of the prototype. Mm-hmm. Could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there? 'Kay, Alice. So, sh 'Kay this should be then. Mm-hmm. Have a push button interface. Um Um Yeah. And then we'd have So that's nine point one there so we've got some 'Kay. Just give us a bit of I switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor. At the moment we've just got the simple chip, which costs one. Um, I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing, which puts up to four? We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard, and maybe go with the one the special form buttons, then we could have the speech So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours, kept them all the same colour, then we could have the voice recognition without Yeah, yeah. Um Oh possibly, yeah, yeah maybe. Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic. Um We should Yeah, that would save us one, though we'd still be slightly ov Yeah, yeah. Well, since it's the through the whole technology type thing, um, you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them. Um, whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker, voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have. And then still have the batteries, or whatever they would prefer not uh You know what I mean? The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote. So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, well we have a single curve, which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good. So uh Um, then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel, which was in at the time. Um, sorry that'd be considered fancy. So maybe maybe a two. Yeah. Um, deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition, and if we had either of those for our budget, they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition. Um But not the kinetic. Like the power. No, we c ca yeah, we can't afford both. No may is maybe about neutral plus it it it's got something, but it hasn't got Right. Okay. 'Kay. Okay. Um Mm-hmm. So it says if we make a slightly more fancy, then we lose points innovation, and if we make it more innovative innovative, then we lose points on it being fancy, so Yeah, yeah. Um It does, yeah. Yeah, m um Yeah, it was just doing it quite well. Um, I think we're gonna have to lose some of these, but the moment, as it stands, it's um Uh the sensor using all of its all of its products, all of its buttons, and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from. Okay. Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age. Um, it depends which way you look at it. Maybe a kind of three? Uh d Yeah, so it's So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has. Okay, so we need to So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it? Yeah, yeah we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going. Oh actually we just have a plastic case, then we lose two points, which gets us um In right within the budget range. So that's eleven point seven, and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements. Possibly, yeah. Um And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations. So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of Oh yeah, and that would now be Yeah, that's that's within the budget. Um Do we actually have Do we just have one special uh special forms down here? Um And we we've we've got we've got enough for another we've got nought point eight left, so we've got enough for another Yeah, um But the but but but the I think maybe the special colour, we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different, I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour. Yeah, which I think we should Yeah, they'll still be fine for the for the price. Okay, uh that's probably it. Ne uh Maybe that'll be a second supplement. Then there's a spe a second special form. Um Well you got you got twelve. So I think that should still be okay. Yeah, that's twelve point three, so we're still within budget on that. Um So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it, but generally speaking, we've kept the other attributes to the That's without Yeah. And specially it definitely could fits the the real product What was the what's the company name? R yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company, then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on Um Mm-hmm. Yeah so it's a Whatever fruit was in fashion next year. That yeah, that was uh that was just about all. I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface, which is by far the cheapest. Um So maybe in a sense not having that, maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side? I dunno. And that is like the most standard type of button. Yeah. And everything else has stayed pretty much the same, so Yeah, plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use. Um, well we've still got the kinetic energy. Um Yeah, the speech feature. I think we've cut just about the same. We've maybe lost Hasn't it It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect Um But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics, but But either way, I think we've made it fairly close to what just the the company logo. So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I'm still not quite sure we've established that. Yeah. Um Yeah, maybe we've m Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time, we make it look good, and um, fit the kind of idea of what they want. And then for the more functional buttons, we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway, you're not gonna see it at the start. Yeah. 'Kay. Uh,. That's good. Definitely lemon shaped. You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case. So I think we can we're okay. Then we say it's fine, so it's all good. Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like. And we seem to have least something in each criteria. We haven't completely left anything out, so As an overall product which has to be quite cheap, we've just about achieved everything. We've got the closing. We should just go through this quickly and then Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant. Is this go It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on. one of those things. Like uh, companies can have like a range of products and I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of Yeah. Well, sh we look at the last slide, see if it's got anything else. I think there's one one more to go. It was quite good with this um the white board, having that and the digital pens. Like, that's something that made it a little easier. voice recognition, especially not could Yeah. Yeah, so it's just like the same products, but just put together in a different way. Um Yeah, I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them. So it's not just for us, it's for the experiment as a whole, so Should we quickly look at the last slide? Sh. Is that everything?Well we've made our prototype anyway. We can have a good look at that. Mm-hmm. Y no, it's a slightly curved around the sides. Um, it's almost curved like up to the main display as well. And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down. And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line. And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on. Yeah, it's a bit more fun, isn't it? And it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple, you think computers, like Apple Mac. Yeah, and cherries are fun, summery. Ah, that's the mute. It it'd probably have to be labelled mute. But um, we didn't have anything small enough to write. Yeah. Uh, we just chose simple shapes for all them. Um, the important ones are the volume ones. So we made them a bit bigger. The mute could possibly be a bit smaller. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus. Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important, but we didn't have any white Play-Doh. So that's where the colour buttons came from. Uh, that's it. Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box. Yeah. S Um,. D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well? You know how you turn that one to a zero, wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things, so you need both of them? I think the voice recognition. But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery. Yeah, I'd maybe give it a a two. One's true. And a four is neutral. Yeah, 'cause we haven't got the double curve, so we can't like say it's completely true. But it's pretty close. We've got almost everything we can. Yeah. Yeah, I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit. Maybe a three. I would give it more than a four. How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much. If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough. And then it stand the test of time better. Mm-hmm. Well, I suppose it's rubber as it is, isn't it. Yeah. Yeah, two or three. I'd be happy with a two. Yeah. Yeah, I would say so as well. Yeah, it's got the cherry and the sponginess. Maybe two? Yeah, that's a bit rough at the minute. Uh, well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine. Yeah, two or three. Well, the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing. It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper. But um, I think the logo would definitely be recognisable. And it does have attributes that other products do. Two? Aye. Go for it. What does what do all them numbers mean then? Do we add them up and rate or anything? we'll probably have to re-rate it. Ah it's on. Yeah, I think that'd be fine. Because that was just a trend, and we do have rubber buttons anyway. Yeah. Yeah, I think we should just imagine white buttons. Yeah. Yeah, the volume ones should stand out a bit. Real Reactions? Yeah, I don't see how we could make it any more. Um, apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue, like the casing. But then what colour would you make the R_s? No, I just We got the logo off the web browser. Mm-hmm. Um, I don't think they would really need to be. I think if they were just all small round blue buttons, it'd be fine. Needs to be an enter button, but could just be the same as well. Mm-hmm. Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion, go to a three? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel. 'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all. Alright. Did we decide what that was, which button it was? On the volume ones? Right. Um, can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac? And did we make it a cherry officially? Right. So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale? Right. So do we have anything else to discuss? Huh. Yeah. I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project. I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing. I can't think of a better example at the minute. Well it's a different application of it. Yeah. Well leadership's a bit of a funny one, isn't it. But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager. You were the leader. So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours. Yeah, very nice. But I mean, I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these. I mean, they record what you're writing, and then what do you do with it? Where do you get the recording? Do you plug the computer or something? Right. I think you watch a video of it kind of. Voice um recognition thing. Pretty much.No, you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere. Yeah, you have to you have to close that window. 'Cause that's the save one isn't it, so And then find it. You pass it round to have a look. Mm very nice. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So it is, yeah. Cherry would be alright actually. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Copyright, yeah. What's this this one? What's that one there? Oh, okay. Right. Uh-huh. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'll see if I can find them. Have Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype? That's the pr Okay. we should plug it in. Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one. We could do it as we d go along, the production costs, looking at the prototype. Well do we'll do it on the prototype, so do two, see how much it is. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think you just do one, don't you, for the I think I think it's just it's just a one. Else I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material, rather than per button. I don't know though. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You've just gone off the window into another one. It's on the bottom row. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we have to have it Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first, and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after? Okay. Right um, I have a little thing. So, we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven, isn't it, with everything we want on. Yeah, I just had a presentation to do. Mm-hmm. Mm. Right okay um, This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here. And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype, and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated. And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research, and also finance, I guess. And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven, so if it's neither true nor false, then that's four. So, I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well, at the end. Um so, We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy. Um The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation. Whether it's easy to use. Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer. And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product. And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently, so I'll go over here. Right. So the first one is um, does the product look and feel fancy. So if we do a sort of a one So Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of but I think What Is one false, or is t one true? I forgot. One's true, and okay. Seven's fal Four is neutral, okay. So Right. Okay. Right. I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space. So, false is seven, true is one, and So uh say about a two for fancy, you think? Okay. Okay, well d you do an average at the end, I don't know. Um Uh-huh. This this is just this is just for like the look. Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional. So Yeah, so that so sh should we go for a a two on that? 'Kay. And I mean, how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon? D yeah. Okay. So, what about the pr The prototype as it is, we've got we've got the speech recognition on it, haven't we. But not the kinetic. Alright, so So it doesn't It's pretty The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the Okay. Yeah. Right, okay. Mm-hmm. S I'm just gonna check my email. I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product. Okay. But I Okay. Yeah., I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is, I think, so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design. I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or. So, I mean does this need to go up a bit or something, 'cause we've got both the both the um the speech Yeah. Yeah. Um, for for innovation, so we've got the speech the speech thing, and Do you reckon a two? Okay. Two. And the next one is I'll have to get it back up now. Okay. Um Say about a three maybe? It's a two. Yeah, this is This Yeah. So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing, as well as having the logo on and all that. So sort of Is it sort of a recognisable product. Does it fit in with our other other products, which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft. What do y Yeah. Uh-huh. So Two or three? Yeah. Two or three. How Two. Okay. Right. Yeah. Yeah we s yeah, I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be I'm just gonna do this in my head. One point eight isn't it or something. I think, anyway. So yeah, pretty close to a two. So So it's I mean it's pretty good at the moment, but it's gonna get worse, isn't it. But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad. Yeah. Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances I'm not sure. Yeah. it's come on already. Mm. Yeah. Different different colours, yeah. Yeah, I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case. Lose a little bit on the fashion, yeah, but And then Yeah. Yeah. Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements, you know. One original colour and then sort of two supplements, I think maybe. Okay. So we only ne we only need two for that. 'Cause I mean these these are moulded. The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber, isn't it. Right. Yeah, that Yeah. Okay, so tha So shall we do a Well, um Yeah. Yeah, so Uh So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button, then maybe they could be a different shape. Like we got a cherry one. Maybe other ones could be something else shaped. I don't know. That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different seeing as we've got, you know, we've made it a a special form, so And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one. And it would sort of, you know, keep it quite fancy as well, I don't know. Well you could Yeah. Yeah, I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something, maybe. Okay. So, we've what have we what have we rid of. We got rid of the plastic. Is it The rubber. Yeah. Yeah. But uh So I mean, we've got we got rid of the rubber case, but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form, and an extra colour for the buttons. So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability, we're pretty much the same, maybe. So, I mean we could maybe put two again on them. Yeah. Yeah. And what about the sort of innovation? Do you think Okay. And then, the corporate identity. Yeah. Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity, I don't know. I mean, it's maybe not. I mean Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, well I mean We cou Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, what what what's the company colour? Did you get told what the company colour is or Oh right. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Uh-huh. 'Cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to. Another colour. Or would that be t Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Shall we save the point two for profitability then? Hmm. Yeah. I mean it's the sort of thing that, I mean, you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume. So, if it's dead obvious, then that's fine. But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning, then you're paying a bit more attention. So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important. 'Cause you Yeah. So Yeah, I mean so we've dropped the cost, but Same sort of function? The criteria? It's alright. Just made a load of money. Well, but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber, we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons. le lemon sh I think well, we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something. Or something like that. Yeah. Did did you have to have a rubber case, though, for rubber buttons? Or was it the other way around? Right, okay. Yeah. So that so we've saved Saved two Euros on that. Mm-hmm. Well, we're aiming for um one for all of them. M but it really has to fit into the budget, so I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the Which is fair enough. Yeah. Yeah, I think most Yeah. Yep. I don't know. What's on the agenda? Uh-huh. Finish your meeting now. Yeah. Okay. Oh. I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary. Yeah. Well, we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings, and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one, you know, sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where, you know, you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness, but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons, and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that. You know, you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the thing itself. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control, in a way. I mean it depends what sort of business you're in, I guess. I mean this one seems. From the website it looks it's quite innovative, but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's, you know, fifteen quid. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean if you look at their products on their website here, Real Reaction, I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge. And Yeah. Yeah. we did find a new idea, I mean sort of a kinetic remote control. I've never seen one of them before. batteries, I think. So Mm yeah. Yeah. Mm. That went okay, yeah. Mm-hmm, yeah. I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything Well, I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products. I mean, they've got all these sort of, you know, high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens, and uh I'm thinking, do you know, one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in. Surely they they should produ Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It worked. Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but I think there's a little there's a little um chi There's a little there's a little chip, I think you must plug it into something and it produces a I don't know. Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something, and Page after page. Yeah. Kinetic powered remote control. Um, what was the other one? Vo yeah. Voice recognition, yeah. S Almost. To fill in these fill in these questionnaires Oh no. Hmm? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting.@highlightThe first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top.@highlightIt uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition.@highlightThe initial cost was calculated at 13.70 Euros.@highlightAlthough over budget, the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes.@highlightOn a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (1), incorporation of fashion elements (2), and brand recognition (2).@highlightChanging the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour.@highlightThe team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity, although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed.@highlightHowever, the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting, especially since the requirements restricted it to TV only, and the budget was too small.@highlightFinally, some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition.	The first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top. It uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition. The initial cost was calculated at 13.70 Euros. Although over budget, the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes. On a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (1), incorporation of fashion elements (2), and brand recognition (2). Changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour. The team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity, although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed. However, the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting, especially since the requirements restricted it to TV only, and the budget was too small. Finally, some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition. 
9	Well hi everyone again. Um like before we uh I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go. Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_. It should have nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, colour contrast, sharpness etcetera. It should have a memory switch, a mute button in case the telephone rings or something. Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote. Um. Should be child friendly design with few buttons, colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons. Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose. Um that's right. But uh her very f personal favourite really she, she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote. The industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue. She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colourful. Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant. She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated. Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor, diode transistor, resonator, and if possible a rechargeable battery. Uh and of course a circuit board. And how it would works, you press the button, the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider. She would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore. Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases. The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition, has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small, easy to use and it should be eye catching. From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does. To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on. Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter. So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home. Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel. She feels that's really what people want today. And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser, the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip, should be trendy design, compact and strong, and should have buttons. And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting. Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. What kind of button? Menu? Uh menu th menu, uh one one. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes the buttons are all raised, right? Are raised, mm-hmm. Right. Or have two hands to operate it, yeah. Yes, and it sort of sticks up so that you really you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah, mm-hmm. So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter. Well, I have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons, like that people know, or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what? Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it Yeah. But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols, text or something so that people kn That's right. Okay, yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm. Right, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Now what, what are our special features for the marketing? That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual And then, and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use. You know. Colours. Mm-hmm. Cutest. Yeah. Okay, now uh having said that No, now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done. Now we're gonna talk about financing. Well, there is a production evaluation. Is that you? But that's after the financing. See? Fi see? Um. Okay, we had looks and voice recognition. Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is. Okay uh energy source we say that's battery, right? Okay, now. So we I guess we use one. What? T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected. Well, that's nice. She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would It doesn't work. Hmm. Oh, okay yeah, okay, let's see. Okay, one, okay. Oh go away. Um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need. Uh electronics, simple chip on print? Is that's what we're using? One of those? Come on. Okay, one. Uh regular chip on print. No. That's all we need, the one case, uncurved flat, single curved, double curved. Double curved? One of those? Case materi s supplements. Plastic we said, right? Uh wood, rubber? Uh but, yes but That's just for the case material, so special colours though, we having that, right? And then we have to interface push buttons. Scroll wheel, no. Integrated scroll wheel, L_C_ display? Button. No. Uh, button supplement special colour? Special form? And special material, rubber, wood, yes. Okay. Total seven point six whatever that means. That's the price. Mm? Eight, eight point two. That's hmm? Eight point two, right? So, we looks like we are well within budget. Okay. I guess I should save this I suppose, huh? Oops. Uh-huh huh huh. I just tried that. My documents, computer. My compu Ah oh here it is, yes. Okay, fine. Save. Okay good, so that's the good news. We gonna be popular. Um. So that uh I think financing was pretty simple. Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation. You wanna go to the next slide? Okay. Um I just realised one thing. In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser. And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that, too. Eight, eight twenty, yes. I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty. But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished, as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much. So um we just have to beware of that. I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that. Yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features, okay? So to beware of that. You wanna go to this next slide, marketing expert? I dunno. Yes it is. Mm-hmm. Oh. Why? Wh why you need that up? I think you can make it there. Yes I think uh shape is one. You you gave it a four. Um, I dunno. I think I would give it at least a two. Colour uh I One. I I like the colours. One. Uh, I think I would give it a two. Well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but um I'll give it a three. Uh. Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity. Um. Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy? Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can't, with this particular item, we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things. Uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser. Um. So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process? Uh, um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created? Uh I think personally I think uh I'm pretty happy. Um an and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project? Uh And I think team work I think was very very good, I think we really yeah. Mm-hmm. And uh I think we are we happy with the means we used? We used whiteboard, we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things. Yes, we could. Uh, it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit. Yes, I think so, I think absolutely, and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier. Um did we new did we find new ideas? I think we did. I think we we did, uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here. Are the costs within budget? Yes, yes. Uh is the project evaluated? Yes. Um then celebration. So I I thank you all very much. Um, I think this was very good and um I think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible. Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view. So, thank you. I always get it on here, but getting it off is Ah yes we have time later but we don'tHello Mm-hmm. And she was challenged on that point Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good. You used to have all the buttons Oh that's good, no, that's nice and friendly. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, okay, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Menu button. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Of the screen. Mm, mm-hmm. The next channel in the numeric pattern, or Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm. Okay, okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, well um what what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb, that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand, yeah? The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around, turn it upside down, move it up, up and down, I really like that. You really did a good job on that, my little designers. Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place. That's that's a really good good thing. Yeah, that's great. Mm-hmm. The colour's very attractive. Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute and these mm-hmm On both sides they're mute? So you can push either one? Okay. And this brings the menu up on the screen? This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are Okay. F f okay. Right, very good. Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell. Okay and now I'm supposed to yeah. Yeah. Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent. Symbols on it. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm, 'kay, mm. Mm-hmm. For the snail, yeah, mm-hmm, we have the snail shell. He goes right back into his shell. Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would, that would really work. So I think voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range. Yep uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical. I think we have to, we have to dwell on on on the appearance. We're really gonna have the be the cutest remote control on the block. So I think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition. I think those are the two things to push. The look and the voice recognition. They're gonna be our two selling points. I'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't I? Okay. Ah, but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something. No? Yeah, that's me. Oh, okay. Sorry, sorry. Mm-mm. That's right. Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes? Or Well. I guess it's double curved. Mm-hmm. Rubber, because we're gonna have the soft buttons. Oh okay, the mm-hmm, mm' kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No, 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all, right? Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, I'll take my file down so you can bring it up. 'Kay should be able to get it now. 'Kay, why don't you move just to the next slide right away. Yeah right away. Okay, well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question, will it sell? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of. We can't accept every suggestion of course, but maybe we just need to get a few. And show the the prototype to consumer research groups, we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any. So we have to get some input from those people. And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it, we think it's good, we're gonna get behind it and sell it. Um, next slide please. Okay, now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype. I wanted the shape to be biomorphic, I didn't want anything with angles and all square, I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that. The size is small, the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted. We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible, we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped, even though it's gonna be hard plastic, it feels good in your hand so that's nice. And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it. So paradoxically the other features, in other words, the look, the feel um and the shape, that's what people are gonna get in the store. They don't have a television in the store, they can't play with it. Um so they'll be our main selling points. So um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please. Okay, so um the shape um I think is a a one. That's really, really excellent shape. The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the, for the marketing, these aren't i in how I feel. I think that it's I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven. I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors. And our colour I think is great. The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there. And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible. And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality, obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality. So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it. Yes. Ah. Well, um we had what, eight eight euros twenty as our cost? And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend. Mm-hmm. Well um that's Mm-hmm. Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price, the the the problem is quality. So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us. And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway. As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products. Uh, well I isn't this my last slide? Maybe. Go ahead. I think that was my last slide, yeah. Um. Mm okay. And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard. Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now, so if you put my last slide back up there. I'm sorry I've um forgot to do that, um. Hmm? Well because I can't remember what I put on there. Okay. Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here. Mm 'kay. You ready. So now we're all supposed to say what we think. Um okay so on shape I gave it a one. Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst. Um what do you think the shape is? One, okay, and Be Betsy? Okay, uh-huh one, okay. And how about on size? On size I gave it a four, yeah, I feel it's just average. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay you're the designer, of course you wanna give it a one. Um and then how about how we doing on colour? Colour, I gave it a one. I really like all those nice bright, warm colours. One. One, one, one, okay. And how about the feel? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand. Okay, I gave it a three, two, yeah? Three. Two, okay. And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here, but Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Two, okay. Three? Okay. Well, um. It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product. Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe, heaven forbid, having another meeting. But um otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product. Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate? Mm-hmm. Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech. So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons, instead of having two mute buttons. And um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control. Maybe we can put that all on one button. Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that. Mm-hmm. No. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm pretty happy with it too, yeah um, it's something I think I can market. Yeah. I think you've done a good job, Miss leader. Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more, yeah, we didn't use that enough. Mm-hmm. And we used the slide because it was better positioned. Mm I think that's true mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think we were we were very good, yeah, mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yes, yes. Celebration. Today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Watch I I have my cord behind you here. Okay. But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time, whenever we felt we were finished. It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace. Oh, there we go.Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Uh so this is our what uh we have made. This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build. Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive um and it's it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a uh uh a looks-wise it is beautiful. Uh and also compact in shape. Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily. Yeah, oops, sorry. Um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als yeah. Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it. And then um uh for the for the led, for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared. And and the button button's part uh will be explained by F Francina. Tell, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah of course, and also Hmm. Yeah. Yeah we can Text. Text that we can have on the case itself, we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons. Yeah. Yeah. So it is yeah, yeah shell. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah, of course, yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. No. Yeah. This is a Yeah. Yeah. I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I think that's the price. Maybe it is it just n Yeah. AMI. AMI should for Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Eight twenty so We have um four euros, yeah Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, still. Yeah. Included, yeah. Hmm, hmm Yeah, even my yeah, shape is one. Yeah, even I think it is one. It's quite small. Yeah, one. Uh maybe two, yeah. Uh three, mm-hmm. Yeah. Maybe we can yeah, include some more buttons and uh um yeah features. We can make the buttons few buttons smaller. Uh I think they are quite big, so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case. If we want to have more features than that. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Mm-hmm. Yeah, definitely, yeah, two mu mute buttons. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Even I'm happy. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, many. Yeah. Ah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you very much. Do we do we have some time left? Uh you have Oh, alright.Hello. Designer. Yes. Yeah. Just the look like, the button part I'll explain. Okay. Now the um we decided upon including certain features on our remote. Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared. Now uh we have included the switch on and off button. Now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model. Then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels. We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume. And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels. Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button. Menu button. Yes, menu At the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour, sharpness, brightness of this uh picture. We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button. Now this is uh a special, special feature which we have included. Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel, if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel. It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button. No, swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap, this button. Yes. And at the end, it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly. So this is our proposed model. Now the marketing expert has to give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective. Yes, yes. Yes. Mm. Abs okay. No, these the front buttons which are here, are the mute buttons. Yes, yes. Yes. Pardon me? This is the menu yes, yes. A the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes, and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels. Scroll up or scroll down the channels. Yes, it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols. Yes, which can be easily recognised. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape. A shell shape. Yes, yes. Yes, snail shell. Yes. Mm-hmm. Y Yes Yes. Yes. Yes. Single curve? Mm. Plastic. Is this for the case? Yes. Yes. Yes. No. Speci Yes Yes d we do have special form. One two three four five six seven eight nine Nine points, okay, yes. Okay. On the desktop. Okay. Fee selling. Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes, yes. Yeah mm. Worse, okay. One. One. One. Yes. I'll give three. Two. We can always improve, yes. Yes, features. Yes. Voices. Yes. Yes. And maybe Yes. Yes, yes you've done a good job. Whiteboard more, yes, yes. Yes. No. Yes. Cel celebration yes, yes. Thank you. Okay. They say it's forty minutes.

10	Okay. About the components design. Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or, a as an optional thing, a kinetic energy, like in a watch, which you just shake and it produces energy. But if we choose for that option, the docking station would c become obsolete. So I don't think it's really an option. Uh for the casing, uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing, single or double curved casing. It's really up the the design that we're gonna use. It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions. Uh as a case supplement, we could um, I thought of that l later, uh a rubber uh belt, like a anti-slip. Uh for the b buttons, we can use plastic or rubber. And the chip-set, um it says simple here, but it should be advanced, because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen. And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed, um people like wood, but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image, unless we would start two product lines. Form should follow function overall. Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy. But depends on what we want. I think we should disc discuss that. Um for the case, uh the supplement and the buttons, it really depends on the designer. And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control. And that's it. Yes w there there are four options. We could use the basic normal battery. Uh a hand dynamo. But I don't think that's really an option. You don't wanna swing before you can watch television. Uh solar cells. But not every room is very light so it's not a very good option. Or the kinetic energy. Well y you basically shake your remote, and then it powers up. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Oh. Mm I don't have any information on pricing. So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department. But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess. It's a bit higher percentage, but Okay. And that's the best choice. Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display. So it's gotta be advanced. Mm I dunno. I'll have to uh research. Yes. Yes. Well the the general like most older remotes are flat, just straight. And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases. Um it would just only affect the form, for as far as I know. So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use. It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality. Pick one you like, yes. Yeah. I think we should start by by choosing a case. Because that's the basis you're building on. So I could draw them out. Let's look at the flat case. Oh. It's from the side so it's rather normal. The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like, but I think it's something like this. So this type should be better for you or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit. And the double curved s looks something like this I guess. So th those are the three options we have. Yeah. It's more logical to have it on top as well because, like on your mobile phone, it's always above. Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page. Okay. Okay.Good afternoon. Sure. I'll start off then. Doh. 'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days. Um we've done some market research. We distributed some more enquetes, questionnaires. And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends. And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers, after the original trend-watchers return, about what the the best design would be. Um okay these are some overall findings. Um most important thing is the fancy design. Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor. Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design. By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls. Um about half of, half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use. Um for our um group, we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old, this is um, these factors are slightly more equal. 'Kay these are some more group specific findings. Uh the older people prefer dark colours. Uh they like recognisable shapes, and familiar material. And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people. Um this is, this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have. Um this leads us to some personal preferences. Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room. Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs. Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest, because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control. So this would be very important that we at least include these features. Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be, the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped. So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station. This is not really This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people. So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station. So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped. Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions, one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel, and one with a grey-black colour. The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people. People with more money. Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means. That would be all. Any questions? And how exactly does the kinetic energy work? You just You use it and it works. Okay. Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it. And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete. And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product. Um wel Yeah you could load up the batteries, you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there. That's true. I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price? 'Cause in our earlier um market research, if you'd allow me to go to the flat board, SMARTboard. Um so it was open here. Um we also um asked if w they would, if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control. Well you can see here, our target group would not do that. So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control I would greatly advise not to do it. I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product, that is meant for the younger people. Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was, would you prefer it. So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it. And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use. And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use. Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones. So pretty large. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour. So it wouldn't actually have to be wood, if it's just wood-coloured. Probably. Yeah that is true. Yeah. We would have to look carefully into the design though. 'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover. The more original one, or the more standard one. So that would Well I wouldn't design a telephone but Well no I think w we should just, we should then just design one um one remote, but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one. So, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem. Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat, single and double curved. Could you explain that a little more? Mm-hmm. And what would single curved and double curved mean? Okay. So we can pretty much just do whatever we want. 'Kay. That's good. No just to lie down. We'll go for that. Well or besides it. Mm-hmm. Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side, so you could, so your thumb would be easily Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_. So that would be great for that. Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side. For left-handed users also. For the volume. Um well that could Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy, ease of use. But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides, that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote. 'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff. That is true. Yeah. Yeah. That is true. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And I'd prefer the corners to be round. Think that would be better. Friendly on the eye. Yeah. Yeah. Very good.No. Mm no. Um 'kay um yeah. uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface. Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons. So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design. So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control. Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition. So maybe uh we can uh use uh that. Um Uh and uh using a little uh display. So um findings. Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions. So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound, um for uh on-off, um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down. Um uh let's see. Um yeah and Uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it. So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles. Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting. Um and yeah overall um user-friendly. So uh using uh large large buttons. Um It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition. Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control, you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal. So uh uh yeah. And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something, you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or A and uh yeah. Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh. Um Let's see. Uh yeah. I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles, um just one button to keep it uh simple. Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles. Um double push push um, if double click, um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles, for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles. So uh Um Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use. The on-off, sound on-off, sound higher or lower, um the numbers, uh zero to uh uh nine. Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel. Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons. And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on. So um made a little uh picture of uh it. Um See. Um yeah. Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner, um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place. Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button. So um D display uh of it, it's uh just a small display. Uh um you can put it uh on top. Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh, most of looks at. So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel, um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down. Um it's uh quite uh handy place. So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button, uh for sound uh Uh and uh for our design, um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so And that's it. Mm. Nah. But what's the function? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries. B b Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe. Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more. So I believe one battery uh is just enough. Uh so Okay. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh. Mm. Mm. 'Kay. Yeah. But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display, or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use? Okay. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh I dunno. Mm. Mm. Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case. So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones, uh when you can change the case of it. So maybe it's possible uh possibility. So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control, and um yeah you can sell uh few uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. Mm. Uh we can just use the regular form of it, but it's um not quite uh fancy. So um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For uh Uh for Yeah yeah. Mm. Yeah we um Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up? And on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting, uh for for the sound? Or Or isn't it? Yeah okay. Uh. Mm. Yeah but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See um yeah. Or we have to make a left uh For lefties and Um You mean um Yeah if Mm no. Yeah. Um Yeah. It's just uh u using uh your thumb. So um it's Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. So um Do you say this um S uh Uh you got like uh sort of a I believe There? So um you want to put a display over here? Or not? Yeah. Um Yeah. Uh we can make it um Mm? That's the top. So uh this top. This down. Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um Let's see. Um Colour uh okay. Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour. Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand. So um Uh it's an So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand. So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh Yeah. Uh rem Yeah but this place um Uh it's Yeah I dunno um Yeah. Yeah so So Five minutes. Yeah. Yeah. But um the on-off button, um still on the top uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.Okay. Uh good afternoon. This is our third meeting already. I hope you enjoyed your lunch. I did anyway. Um let's see. Presentation three. Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today. It's the conceptual design meeting. And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components. Uh conceptual specification of design. And also trend-watching. Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes. Um but first I'll show you the agenda. Uh first the opening. Then we have three presentations. Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts. How we're going to make it. And then we're closing. We have about forty minutes. Uh so I suggest let's get started. Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation? No? Everything fine? That's nice. Then a little uh thing about the last meeting. Uh these are the points um we agreed on. The requirements and the target market. Uh requirements are uh teletext, docking station, audio signal, small screen, with some extras that uh button information. And we are going to use default materials. Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements? Maybe? No? These are just the the things we thought of, so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else, just let me know. And maybe we can uh work it out. And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers. So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing, um I suggest let's get started with the presentations. So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time? Okay. Good luck. Okay. Thank you. Any questions about the the trends? Mayb No? Okay, we go on to the next one. Okay. Uh thank you. Okay. Thank you. So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts. Mm. 'Kay. So these are the points we have to discuss. Um first I think we can talk about the energy source, since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price, uh and image. Uh so uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget, I think. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place. And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms. So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place. And also what you said. Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote. But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station. So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push, and then it starts beeping. And then we can we can still use the voice recognition, but maybe then for only the the channels. That's safe. Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah, sure. Go ahead. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Easier to use? No, I think that's a good point. Yeah. I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use, with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it. Because it's just uh some extra information, and it's easy to ignore as well. So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it. And um yeah I think the um Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition. Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly. And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use, as well. So that brings us back to the energy. If we don't have the voice recognition, it will it won't use a lot of energy to use. Um So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy, but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good. And much cheaper as well. So Okay let me just choose for the battery. That brings us to the chip. Just the advanced. Okay, advanced chip. And then we get to the point of the case. Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well. Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey. Or both? Um as we saw there is not Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce. Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive, which they can show off to their grandkids. Look I've got a new remote control, and uh Yeah. That's right. But with colour was a lot more expensive? Or? You don't know? I think so because Yeah. It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape. Yeah. Change the cases. Yeah. You can sell the cases. Yeah. I think that's a very good option. Because um then you can advertise as well with the Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control, or whatever. Because that's a it's something extra, it's something other remotes don't have, which we can get a great advantage point. So and then you can make them with colour. Black and grey, other colours as well. Costs. Yeah. Yeah. So you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply, yeah remote controls, on which you can apply different case covers, for example. Remote. Yeah. Okay. So everybody's okay with the changing covers? I think that's a good uh good option. Changing case covers. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Uh but the form has to be um It has to It's has to be possible to stand up? Or just only to lie down? And the the cover of the the docking station is also on top of the television then? Or not? And you can just yeah then click it in. That's okay. Um so the interface. What type of interface do we want to use? Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the on the the board. Does somebody have ideas for a form or Yep. Mm. Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult, and then it's But you have extra buttons. So people can get confused. Especially if they have the same writings on it. Can't we make uh Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one? Then you have to Let's see if I ca A blank one. And then you get Here's a little L_C_D_ screen. Uh now I have to think. It's a plus and a min. No it's not very handy I think. Because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of No that's not gonna work. I guess. Maybe we should Yeah. But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand? I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel or Y yeah. Yeah. I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape. Uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy. In one or ano another way. Yeah. Um yeah just Yeah. Easier? 'Kay. I suggest um the single curved, because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in. Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen, because it's a bit, it has a bit of a angle. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. But now it's Do you have it upside down or Do you have it this that's top? Okay. Yeah. So get your mouse. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good one. But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top. So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here. If you can have this one, you turn it like this. And then flip it upside down. Because uh maybe your hand is in the way, if you have the display here. I think i On top. Yeah.. So then we get Here's That's the curve. Here the display, and then buttons. Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe. Just that's for left hand and right hand users. And then h the rest of the buttons over here. Yeah still here jus That's Yeah. Should be more bit more friendly, yeah. 'Kay. Supplements. That's okay. Where's my mouse? Then We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use. So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design. It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote. So check out the corporate website maybe. The user interface design, it's the same story. And product evaluation. So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one. But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach. So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder. And then we're going to uh try to finish our project, and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers, I think. Which are Uh let's see. I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first. And then you'll get a message. So that's uh basically it. Maybe this one? Then we can save this one in the folders group. Uh yes, it's here. SMARTboard, there it it. So if you wanna have a look at it, it's over there in the projects folder. And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again.

11	Hi. Mm-hmm. Interface designer. Yes. Yes. Okay, I can start first. Okay. Now my slide, please. Three. Participant three. Yes. Okay. Now as an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface, how the remote looks like so that it is sellable, it is attractive to customers. Next, please. Okay. Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television. This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel, like you can have the numbers one, two, three, four, up to nine. Pardon me? Yes, nine numbers. And then you have swapping of uh button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa. Then it should have a next button, and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one. Next slide, please. Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume. Then, there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television. For example, if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English, then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the the subtitles on the screen. Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour, colour of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture. Now there should be a memory switch. There should be a mute button. Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call, and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_, but he he can reduce the sound, he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the T_V_. Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature. It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit. So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers, you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television, for example, if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel, uh th now the the uh yeah, the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel. So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities. So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have. So this is one one of the interface which can be created. A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features. Then, please, next slide. Then, these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour, but they have many buttons. So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that. So you can you can design an interface which is very simple, and which is user-friendly. Even a kid can use that. So can you go on t t uh to the next slide. Yeah, so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser. And this has multi-purpose use, it can be used for T_V_, it can be used for cable-satellite, it can be used for V_C_R_, D_V_D_s and audio. And this has in-built voice recogniser. Can you go on to the next slide? Yeah, now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use. Uh this is user-friendly, it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it. And this comes with different colours, different shapes. And this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons and all the important uh buttons are there in this small, compact, attractive child interface. Next slide, please. Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace. this. So this is No this is a very big, you cannot misplace it anywhere. So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose. This i this is one such interface which can be created. And the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function. Thank you, that's Mm yes. Okay. Okay. We can. It works. Mm yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Transmit. Okay. Okay. Push-buttons. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Uh yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser. This could be uh one feature which could be sellable. Mm-hmm. No, it's it's, uh yeah, it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already, and then you're expecting an answer from th For example, you have a T_V_ system, I'm the user and my family members are the user, I will already record uh a question like, uh good morning, like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television. So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on. It will recognise my voice and will switch on. Battery. Yes. Yes. And compact. Trendy design and compact. Yes. Push-buttons. And Supplements like different types of features buttons, like can have a f mute button or a swapping button. Recogniser. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you.Hi. Yeah, I think that pretty much is it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You don't know me. I could lose that in a minute. Well, um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there. Um what uh I'm No suggestion's bad. But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more. I don't think that we can get uh The T-shape is good, the child one is good, the too big to misplace, I think it's just funny. Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter. It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy. Yeah mm. Mm-hmm. Have to come back to that later. Okay. No, I think her presentation was good, and she really explored all the options. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good point. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. Okay. Hmm, that's interesting. Uh yeah, on the scroll and the push-button, um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button? Mm-hmm. Um. We'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost. Okay. Okay. Go right to my first my next slide. Um alright, my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing, and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition, so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers. I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing. And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that, I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have, and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it. And I would encourage you all to do the same. Um and my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful. Um people like something that really fits in their hand. Simple is beautiful. They don't want to have to squint at small print um, they want buttons whose functions are obvious, and they want um as few buttons as possible, and they don't care for the mode thing. They want each button to do something. And eye-catching is important. It's gotta look cute, it's gotta look appealing. Go ahead, I'm trying to finish fast for you. Um and our preference is, as far as I'm concerned, are we got to get to the market before the competition. Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others, so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item. And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign. If we try to tell people it has too many great features, um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere. So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things, I think, that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product. And I've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular. And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular. And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal. They are more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them. So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item. Mm-hmm. You wanna try to come back to yours, and limit yours a bit? Okay. So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned? Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature. That that be really good, yeah, I agree with that. Distance problem? Uh. I think I think battery, and I think we all agreed on that. That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing. Yep. Bright, colourful, trendy trendy design, and strong. Mm-hmm. Well, I think that Yeah, or or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement. Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement. Okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is. Okay. Wherever they're hiding?Hi. Yeah, good. Hmm. Yeah. Going to the nex next. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, maybe. Participant two. Uh the next one, sorry. It's it was the old one. Components. Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design. Uh, can you go on to the next slide, please. I have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction. Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit, battery, etcetera, etcetera, it's like Uh it can be a plastic one, hard plastic, so that it can be strong, even if you just uh uh, you know, if you if it falls down, then it doesn't break. So it should be strong. And uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that. And it should be recyclable. Uh and uh, yeah, and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours, blue, red, green, so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components. And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit. Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller. If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one. And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures. Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside, it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures. And uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility. And the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery, capacitor. Can you go on to the next slide, please? Uh a diode, a transistor, a resonator, these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller. A battery uh, I would like to suggest one thing uh if we uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery, even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much. It it it's not a high voltage battery. Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one, then uh people can use it for a long time, so in that way we can cut cut the cost, but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one. And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller. Can you go to the next slide, please. And how it works, how the remote controller works. When you press a button Thank you. Uh when you press a button, when you do that, you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button, and it will send some signals through the wires, and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed. Suppose you have pressed channel one button, number one you have pressed, then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed. It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button. Every button, every individual button, has its own morse code. Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one, then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button, and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light. Like you have got a signal by pressing a button. That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit. Now, that signal, that morse code, has to be amplified by the transistor. That is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller. It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits. The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light, and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately, that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal, then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do. Then it will do the appropriate action. So uh this is how the remote controller works. Can you go to the next slide, please. Yeah, I have few pictures. When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's it this is a normal remote controller. And to the next slide, please. And where we had a a few buttons and all. And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components, like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins, and also a capac uh a capacitor, three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm yeah, and di and a diode transistor. The electronic components uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d diode transistors an Yeah, di um can y uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um. Uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors, and uh just beside that you can see a transistor, and a uh uh cylinder shape, uh that one is a capacitor. Uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry, ther there is a diode. Can you go go on to the next slide. So uh this is the circuit board. The green one is a circuit board. Actually, uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive. Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper, because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires, it's it's better to go for printing, because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing, nothing like uh, you know, you don't need to use wires and all. It's not exactly wires we are using. It's just printing something on a board. Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits. So th that green uh thing is a circuit board, and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons, like when you press a button, the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the, yeah, um integrated circuit. Can you go to the next slide, please. Uh so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons. Uh can you see the black uh, round marks? They they are the circuits. Next, please. And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls. Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range. Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip. Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery, a more ingenious uh hard dynamo, um a kinetic provision of energy, more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy. So that also we can have in a battery, uh or we can use solar sells. Uh. Yeah. Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases. Uh usually, the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller. Um. Yeah. Yeah, maybe d uh I have just one more slide, I think. Um. Like we can have a ma material such as plastic, rubber, wood, titanium, but titanium we can't use. Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print, um also infra it includes the infrared se sender. Um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker. An Yeah, that's it. It's all for me now, thank you. No, no, no, th the the the scrolling wheels are different, like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls, uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before, I think. Now, nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all. So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons. Yeah uh yeah, push-buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but w Yeah. Yeah, but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work, because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems, issues. Yeah, it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice, like maybe different people will be having different voices, so it like it's uh everything so i So to get a good recogni recognising system, it's a costly thing, I think. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And also strong. Trendy, yeah. Uh. Um like the switches, like we use buttons for user interface. Push-buttons. Yeah. Mm yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Thank you.Okay. Hello everyone. Um how uh how we doing? Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting, more or less. Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working, meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given. Uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use. Um it's also an item that people lose a lot. So we should address that. And, of course, it should be something s s that is very simple to use. In addition to that to make it sell, of course, uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive, or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because, in particular with smaller items, that's a very important fact, 'cause um if they say, well, I go home and think about it, that won't work. Um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve. And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan. Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip. Therefore, messages uh will be controlled in the same manner. There should be extra features like lid buttons, maybe a beep. If too many buttons are pressed, mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um you could see the time, you know, what show they want to watch. Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes. So the components of the thing should be button, bulbs, infra infra-red bulbs, battery, chips, wires, and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item. Francino who is our um interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it, of course, should have an on-off button, and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock. Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable. It should be compact. Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped. And maybe have an anar alarm-clock. And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature. Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves. Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature. And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote. Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time? Okay. Okay, then we I'm looking for three presentations. And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh, I don't I don't think so, so whoever w wants Yeah, okay. Okay, your slides. Okay. Oh, come on, close already. And that's number two, right? Three. Okay. Nine what? Nine channel uh switches? Nine channel switches? Is Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay, thank you very much. Uh any comments on uh her presentation? Yeah, I I th I think No, I think the these are her presentations, but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after but if I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation. Mm right. Mm-hmm. Ho who wants to go next um? Mm-hmm. Okay, and you Uh okay. Oops. The components design. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go away. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. And you have more pictures. Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting. Okay, well thank you. Any particular comments by anybody? We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision, and the marketing expert has to present her her thing. Uh okay. Okay. Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone. And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote. And uh so what do we think on the concept of the remote? Y Okay. Mm-hmm. I think that's Mm-hmm. Well, you you teach You have to teach uh Okay, before we get too far off here um, the components of the concept is the energy. What kind of energy do we foresee? Battery. Battery. Okay then chip on print. Okay. And the case. And I think we all agree on the case, we wanna have something uh maybe bright, colourful. Mm-hmm. Trendy design, compact and strong. User interface concept, uh interface type, supplements. That will be your area I think, right, Jana. Put uh k I guess uh for yeah. And Not sure what they mean by supplements. Oh, like Oh. A what? Right, right, right, mm-hmm. Right. Okay. Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes, and the uh I_D_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then, to have the look and feel design, and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design, and the marketing expert with the product evaluation. In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay, it says here. You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches. Um if you have any questions, you know, you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach, I suppose. Um so um I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in uh uh thirty minutes, according to our timetable here.

12	Okay. Yeah, my name is Francina. And I'm uh an user interface my role is uh the main responsibility is user interface. And my role is to design uh a television remote control. Yes, I'm Francina. Yes, sure. No, Okay. What should I draw? I'm going to draw a snake. How does it look like? Yes. Yeah, I Yes, I I feel that all the remote should be very compact. Yeah, those which we get here nowadays it's very long. And um and it should have multi-purpose. Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_, it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also, like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system. Yes, exactly Yes. Yes. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, design should be, yeah it should be different. All the almost all the remotes Yes, exactly. Are different shapes. Yes. Yes. Or a b Should ha A fluorescent signal, yeah. Yes. Yeah. And uh Yes. Then, in that case Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. Yes.Yeah. Yeah. Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui. Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design. Snake. Yeah, of course, using remote control. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Audio player. Oh. Okay. Hmm. Divides us Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah, maybe ten I do yeah, colours and al shapes also. Yeah. Yeah of course yeah. Yeah. Yeah, some beep or something like that, so that we can go Yeah. Yeah, maybe it should have a light so that we can, we can just recognise where it is. Yeah, yeah. May not be beep. Beep or uh it's a light, maybe it's a light. Yeah, probably yeah, probably it's a yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, of course, that didn't I i we can't do it. Yeah, good point. Me yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's functional de yeah, exactly, technical. Yeah. Uh working design, yeah, it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design. Yeah, functional design, and you Yeah. Yeah, even I have. Yeah, even I have, I think, yeah. Yeah, so let's see. Hmm. Yeah.Okay. I think so. Yeah, that's a good plan. And I'm a marketing person. I wanna figure out how to sell them. My name is Eileen. Okay. Mm-hmm. No. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay so Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay. Functional, conception and detailed. Maybe we should redesign it. After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that. Okay, I'll see what I can do. See if I r See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something. So that it will record okay. Um uh um traditional kitty cat. I've a very fat cat. And it likes to sit like that. Okay. Am I supposed to wipe off that or okay. Okay. Uh, okay. I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged. Profit. Um is fifty mm. Oops. At um twelve fifty Euros per Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that. We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things. That's right. Yeah okay, friendly shape, that would help. I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap, because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them. They can't find it. Mm-hmm. So some Uh so, so it's really the beep or, or a light should blink. Mm 'kay. And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay so Okay. So the light sensor would activate the signal. Mm-hmm. But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it. Well, because you're s because you're silly. Because people are silly. I mean it could be on well, i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um, you know, well maybe we have to move along, okay. Mm-hmm. We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price. Mm. Okay, I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting. How about you people? Really? Okay. 'Kay. Alright, well uh Okay, very good.Okay. Everybody ready? Uh I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is? So maybe we start with you? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. And your name is? Okay. Very good. And as you already know I am Betty. I am the project manager for today. So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do. Um. Yes y opening, acquaintance, tool training well, the tools are, I think, we already I guess the tool is really our the computer, as far as I can see. Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there. Project plan, that falls under the same heading pretty much. Um, I don't think we have any great discussion at this point. Um. Here is what this thing should be. This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control. Uh should be original, trendy, and, of course, user friendly. So maybe you wanna make some notes of that. Okay? All right. Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve. Um. That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with. The same goes for the conceptual design, there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards. Detailed design, same thing basically. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I can't write with this thing. Yes. Yeah, okay. All right? Then, tool training try out the white board, participant can draw their favourite animal. Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works? So that in case we have to, in the next meeting, present something on the white board. You wanna go Eileen and Whether you without hanging yourself. And remember you have to press so it works. Mm-hmm. Fat, a fat cat. Okay. And you're Francine, right? Would you like s like just to see um how it feels, so that you have a little idea? In No, no. No, that's okay. I don't know, we'll get to that later. Okay. Okay. Here's the project finance uh which, of course, we all have to think about when we design this thing. Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro. Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro, the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro. Mm-hmm. So these are all things, of course, to remember with the budget and when you design to materials, cost, etcetera. Now, uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control? I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em, right, everyday. And um now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it, things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas? Would you like it to be smaller, bigger, have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons, you know, things like that? Small, right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically. Well. It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have. Now, of course, the other thing to think there is maybe the design. Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know. Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know. Um so yeah shapes right, you know, like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something, you know. Yeah. Yes. That is true, because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or, we you know, whatever. And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say, where the hell is my my remote control yeah? Well or yeah or if it's really, if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So if lost If lost uh signal with b throw signal, you know. Exactly, I mean just that's what I'm saying. I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or Okay, my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden, in in other words if it's like in a dark spot, uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top, a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant, at that moment it's it's like, it's like um, what you call it a light s sensors, you know? In in that moment it has a sensor, i it it gets a certain darkness, it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep, I mean, that we can discuss that later, you know. That's right. You know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough. Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff, you know, you can clap on and off, but I think they only work to certain degree and What with Oh yeah well, but then those people we can't help everybody. Okay we have uh yeah, we have to move along, but I think we have some good good points to start with here. Okay, the next meeting will be in thirty minutes. I think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this? Okay so well, you got the notice um uh. The working design, I guess that's the function I_D_ uh who is this? The industrial designer That's you. Okay. So, we looking for a working design when we come back. Then And then the technical funct you are the technical function, so so you are the working design. So you have a working design and then a functional design. And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness, and what we just discussed in general. That would be your idea. And, of course, price. That it, that it, that the price is a good price. I mean, the price is given, but, that was That's right. That's right. And, you know, specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that. I think that's the end of the show. Yeah. So um we have well, we have a twen two two two three minutes. Um any questions at this point? Or uh suggestions? I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh, uh I guess, you can uh Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes. And see what we can come up with.

13	Wouldn't wanna be Project Manager. Uh, what we going to do. Um, once again I'm uh gonna take minutes. So, um no presentation for me. Uh, first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_. Afterwards some uh eval eval evalu evaluation s sorry. Uh evaluation crit criteria. Uh, in combination with the finance I um uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file which we have to fill in later on. Um, you see. Uh, and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro. So, that's uh that's a big l so let's uh wait it uh um we have we have must uh, we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah, quite a lot of mathematics. And after that, uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard, with the with our laptops, with the all uh all this. And uh afterwards, uh we closing. Once again, forty minutes, so uh let's start. I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation. J_ and J_. Mm. No, okay. It's called a weemote Weemote. Yeah, I can imagine that. Yeah, but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people. Uh, we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it, uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features. So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard, and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated, more traditional look, they're willing to pay uh that. They want uh they want more luxury stuff, but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that. So, maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours. Not too, but w a little, because that's our aim. Yeah. Well, the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of yeah. It Yeah. Okay. Thank you. The Marketing Expert. Sorry. Okay, so we gon we gonna evaluate the Yeah, the the thing we saw. Okay, just saw. Yeah. Seven? Uh, true. Sorry. Yeah, one I think. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yes. No teletext buttons. Teletext is in the menu. Volume is true. Yeah, big and clear. Oh, okay. Well, I agree. I was thinking very black and white. Thank you J_. Fruity. Yeah. Well, we p we can do it glow in the dark. So, if it's in the dark place, you still see it glowing. I think Ah, you must see it as uh, w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls, there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room, this one will stand out, I think. Exa I think that that's what it's about. If it if this lying on your couch, you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing. So Yeah. Okay. That's our remote control. True. Yeah, but not too soft we have decided. Three, yeah. Easy to use. One. Yeah, can it be zero? Yeah. Okay, two. Yeah, two. What's the time? We also have uh to do the evaluation, uh the production costs and uh stuff. Yeah. You're agree, Tim? You haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh Paris? False. Yeah, but they are built in, so it's one. Okay. Freak. Okay, thank you. We'll see. Mm. Okay, we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost. If it's under uh twelve and half Euro, then it's uh ok uh okay. But i is it if it is b Huh? No, this isn't right. Okay so,. Redesign. Oh yeah, if they under Yeah. No. Oh yeah. Yeah, it's sorry. Yeah, if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro, uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation, as we have uh experienced it. Otherwise, we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy. So Uh, we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components. We have to uh fil uh, want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro. So, do we have uh a hand dynamo? No. That's zero. Battery, one? Okay. Kinetic, one? Okay, solar cells, zero. Okay, uh simple chip on print? No? No, advanced chip. Sample sensor sample speaker? Three? Yeah uh, but it it's one one thing, it's three Euro. Uh, what's the sample sensor? Okay. Zero. Uh, uncurved flat. No. But is it s it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh and then uh no? Okay. So it's only uh once double-curved. Okay. We're now in a problem, 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet. Okay, but uh we have Okay. Uh, rubber. You. Titanium, no? Special colour? Yeah, but we want to make uh the wood colours, uh that uh Yeah, one. Yeah, but we we going to yeah yeah, that's true. But yeah, it's it's it Okay, the push-button, no. Scroll-wheel, no. No. Oh, no. Yes, one. Uh, button, no. No, the the we don't have a s no. Okay. Oh, okay. So, um what's the thing we can change? Uh, can I uh I say something? No, can I say something uh as Project Manager? The kinetic thing, can we just skip it, because uh you have to shake it, but that's not really innovative. Yeah. Yo. Sorry, yeah, yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, and not really. But we if you forget about the kinetic, well if we do that, we shall. So um Uh, b but i but the single-curved is just oh Oh, okay, okay. So that's wh tha that's one option. And then w yeah, and then we could have it, but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look. No, tho uh that that can be done. So uh, okay, a little less uh conversation. Sorry? Fill in Just a explanation. I can delete it for you if you want. So, if we do this, uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro. And we're done. Uh well, the only uh thing that don't Yeah, single-curved, but there's a curve in it. So Yeah, it's really a static value. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Oh. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Do you think? Well, now you can shake your remote control. Kinetic. Yeah? Who because if you want to go to kinetic, you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat, and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise thing. And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve, then it's uh then it's uh yeah, one big good curve. I was going to uh say nasty words, but I don't. This is strange by the way. Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber. We thought that wood would be more expensive. Yeah, maybe. But uh that this is this is it? Yeah. Okay, this is it. I'm gonna save it. Yeah. Okay, well, considering we have Well, we were above, so we did a little redesign Okay, um now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project. Uh, some uh things. Were there uh room for uh was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's true. I agree with that. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Okay. Uh how about the leadership? Okay, thank you very much. Now we're done. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I notice it too. I was a I was also very uh unhappy, uh very unsatisfied uh about the about the first meeting. So, uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk yeah. Okay, so uh that's cool. Uh, teamwork? Well, maybe that's uh only Yeah well, it's for us, because uh Yeah. Yeah and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. But, really teamwork were you two uh The Yeah? No hard feelings. Yeah. Now you you must push a little while. Okay. O Just uh okay. You can be you can go quicker, 'cause then it it won't notice it. I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard, so I think that's the that's the main issue. Um, so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with, um the the the the digital pen. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No. Huh. Well Yeah. M yeah. Yeah. And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word. No, uh that's true. No. And uh the SMARTboard is uh useful, but the the pen is I uh not user-friendly, I think. Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things, and that's the Yeah, but that's not th the the you when you at a foreign audience, you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small. Yeah. But maybe there's some function with no, it isn't. With uh Yeah. Well, I'm gonna erase my uh name. Yeah, it's a big uh big eraser. Um Well, the the idea of the touch-screen is uh I'm just uh I don't know what what I mean. No. Oh. Oh yeah. That's interesting. Okay, because what does it mean? All the mo yeah, are between one and two. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. Thank you, expert. But the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software? Not really, yeah? Yeah, I think Yeah. Yeah. You had expected it to to be uh more more uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep, yep. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, and and maybe some uh functions for uh uh uh circle or uh a square. You have to draw it yourself now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that can be done already. But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh Hmm? Sorry? Well, that's nice. Is it Here. oh. Oh, sorry. Select. Yeah. Here, that. So you have as you saw, you have a little uh Oh, you can Yeah, thank you. You can go uh there. So there the the the functionality is there, but it's not it's not ideal, and it's it's very it costs a lot of time to uh to use. And that's a pity, if you uh if you have uh thirty, forty minutes uh for this kind of things, and we are now with four people, but it well, imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone uh Yeah. Two minutes of drawing, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah, just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write, also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so Uh well, just about, because uh Yeah, tomorrow? Uh, the costs are within the budget. Uh, the project is evaluated. But, before we going to celebrate, uh I have uh a little question which you can't answer, because uh there must be some kind of end report. I am busy with the end report right now. You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh Uh about all the meetings, what we have decided, a r r a report of this day. Uh, that must be made, but I don't know, here is uh standing uh whoa, we can celebrate now, but the end report is Okay well, that uh that can be done. Maybe we can do it uh together. You can see what I've uh yeah? So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board. You can see it. Because I think it will uh it must be uh Yeah, it's a three uh with seventy five uh Yeah, just about. Well, just a moment. End report. No no no, I'm just uh you can s you can read it and uh here here it is. End report. Well, this not nit it read-only. But it's not uh fully finished yet. Um, this is about the functional design, the things yeah yeah. Oh yeah. I'm uh when I said it, I remember I had it here. Marketing Expert, okay. Um about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control. Um, it must be uh simple to use, very clear what to do, and at the younger people. So, this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh yeah. Yeah, I understand you, I can talk a little bit Dutch. Oka okay, okay, I I really didn't knew that. So, this one's first. You go there and you go there. So, okay. Well, maybe I can then do it one two three. If the order is in uh is is uh important, that's the word for. Uh, then the conceptual design. Uh, well all the things we have uh discussed, uh the energy, which uh turn out to be uh batteries, so that's Yeah, because yeah. Uh, he here it is still double-curve, the rubber, the flashy, the fruity, the removable. Uh, the buttons Hmm? Not double anymore. Nay but that this is what um Yeah. And the the added functions like Tetris snake, it's under the parental control, the touch-screen. So, it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh Uh, it's very cheap, you you maybe you you you you come at uh It's very necessary. Yeah, but it still has some yeah. Okay, but so we can discuss that uh we can discuss that kind of things I think with the with the the board of uh What's it what's the company called? I just keep forgetting it. Real Real Reaction. Real Reaction, yeah. Okay, so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh Yeah, okay, that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now. But, i in here nothing uh Mm-hmm. Yes. Yeah, touch-screen I've mentioned. Yeah, okay, well I gonna redesign uh something now. No. Because I think it will Oh, five minutes from to finish meeting. Oh, that's cool, Tim. Finish meeting now. Well, I'm I'm I'm going to finish my end report. I am the one who can say that. Yeah? Hereby the meeting is finished. Yeah.J_ and J_. Evaluation. Hmm. Hmm. Interesting. Ah, okay. Cool. J_ and J_. Jane and Jane. 'Kay guys, take it away. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. 'S l it's like an uh Easter egg. Weemote. Wait what I w got in mind. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover, so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Hmm. Mm. Oui okay. Yeah. An another idea. Uh, maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style. They'll please the elder users as well. Yes. Not not too uh yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Or blue or. Well I I I think so. Yeah, except for the buttons it's it could be a standard model. 'Kay, it's my time now. Okay. During the Oh. During the design uh design life-cycle we uh we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff. Um, now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements. So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis. Um, we're going to do that with a seven point scale. Opening a Word document now. Okay. One oh, okay, uh I have to expla explain something. We have to uh be consensive about about things. So, it has to be a group uh group decision. Okay? Uh We're going to vote. We yeah? The prototype. Yeah. Okay, one. The remote control is designed for people with age below forty. Seven is false. Yeah, b one or Most true? Yeah, so so a o one is appropriate? Or, more like a four. Three. Ah, exactly. Exactly. Three. Yeah. But also for yeah, okay. Uh, second. The remote control is beautiful. Yeah, acco according to us, it's one? Or Yeah, p s Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product. Three. Uh, the remote control looks fancy. One? Good. Four. The remote control has big, clear channel switching buttons. Daniel. Uh, teletext buttons and volume buttons? False? And volume? True. Big and clear? Hey. Hey. Hide. It's it's not yeah, it J Five? Okay. Yeah, it's it's yeah. Red. Okay. Volume. The remote control is easy to be found. Oh, okay, but 'kay, look. If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed, or you throw this remote control under your bed, is it better findable? A li little bit maybe? Four? Fi I Ah, I I I think five. It's it's it doesn't really make a lot of Four? Yes, but five is between four and six. B_. Yeah, it it's Yeah, yeah. But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it. Like, no not uh not seeing it, but lost it in the house or something. But, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I I agree, I agree. Okay. Eight, the remote control has fresh, fruity colours. Yeah, yeah, not too flashy. The remote control is made of soft material. Three? Easy to use? Top easy to use? It's it's not the most easy to use It can be easier. Jus just with ten buttons, that's the easiest. Yeah, but the most uh easy to use is just with one button on t Yeah, okay, but easy n not not the most easy to use, I think. Two? We also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays. So Yeah yeah, I'm uh hurrying. Okay, eleven. The remote control is innovative. A very of course. The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux. The remote control, i it has speech recognition. False. The remote control has built-in games? Yeah. And the last, paren parental advisory function. Yes, I do. Save as. Okay, I will uh do the the math. Now it's your turn. No. Advanced chip. Advanced chip is three. Three Euros, yep. Okay, one piece, yeah. No. Speech recognition, I think. No. No. Thingy. Yes, three. Eight. Okay, go on. Just go on. Two. Two. No. S Yeah, but but D but Daniel, tha that's that's another brand. That's another article to sell. That doesn't account for this. Producing this. No. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Daniel. Daniel, what do you think about Here. What do you think about uh putting a battery in it, but also selling like uh the covers, a docking station just apart from the from the thing, so that you can uh put uh rechargeable batteries in it and just Yeah, yeah, okay. Just an idea. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. Hey, those ar arcs, why are there for? The blue blue uh Okay. No, no no. Yeah. But, wha 'Kay, look, what is the uh If you make it double-curved, it costs one Euro more. But No, but does it have a lot of extra uh fun function more like Yeah. Yeah, uh aesthetic. I mean, uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half. But I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price. No, we can't go above that. Yeah? Yeah, okay. Then it's okay. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. What a what about all the m the environment freaks? Not freaks, the envi No. I I think it's it's It look like this one. Yeah. Yeah. This is it. Ah no, we have to do all those hours again. Go back. One back? Costs on uh No redesign. Yeah. Yeah, okay, yeah. Hmm. I I didn't think so. That there was a lot of room for it. But, that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us. It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there, and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff. Bu Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Leadership was uh crappy. Okay. No, leadership was uh Okay, I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting. Uh, you could have but uh, it was your first, no uh no disrespect or something, but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more. So like, I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting, and Yeah. But About me. Yeah, you made up. No, it you did better. Yeah. Much more constructive. Two guys. Okay. Means. Digital pen, I thought uh th the first time I did individual work, I used it. But, a and the first two meetings I brought it with me, but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting. It's it's not real real use for me. Not really, no. Yeah, like when you do this. Smaller? Oh. Sorry. Okay. New ideas? Do you? Go on. Yeah. Mm, yeah, I think so. Did you heard what he said? I don't I don't know what I mean. Oh, I have some figure. Here. The eva the evaluation, the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six. So that's fairly uh fairly good, I think. Uh, that uh all the requirements uh are true or very true, right. Yep. Yeah. May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here. And draw it, and it's it's placed over there. Hmm? No. Ah, very bad. But I think this is better than regular flip-overs, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but insert image isn't available? Here. Picture from scanner, clip-art. Hyperlink? Hey, what if you do like hyperlink? Type type it? Re Real Reaction dot N_L_. Yes, is now is okay. Okay? Huh. 'Kay, double-click it. You're erasing. Double-click it. Yeah. Yep. What I really miss also is uh is a d is a turtle is a decision uh decision system like um With the evaluation, you have to Polls like, what do you want, a one, a two, maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven. Yeah, j ju ju yeah, v voting application. Just a little group group decision application. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, of course. But, uh you can still discuss about it, but but click it in an application, that's a lot easier to process. The digit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's it? Celebration. Yeah. Yeah. What is an end report? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you ha you have ten minutes left, I uh read. You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report. Yeah. Um You you already made a beta version, or Pages. Okay, Daniel. Do you want a chair maybe? Hey? Oh, okay. Five minutes for finishing. Management Expert, you have to change that. Marketing. Yeah, but you can save it u the under another name. Maybe um the The Yeah. You Yeah. No, you have to put uh, switch channels uh at the top, because that's the most used function and teletext at the second Oh nay, a volume changing, second. S switch, yes. Yeah. Okay, go on. Yes, very good. Yeah. Yeah. The order. Single-curves. No, okay. Was initial, the plan. The initial plan. No, it's it's not very cheap, but that no, but it's a development inside corporation. Like, uh w we don't have to buy parental control. Our own people can make that, I think. Yeah, it it has some cost, but Yeah. Real Reaction. Okay. Still the end conclusion. That's all, I think. Yeah, but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion, I think. Why we decided to use a flat uh L_C_D_. Yeah. Um Save it. Hmm. Yeah, but then you had the same thing. Example of children remote. Oh wait. Wait. Hmm. That's a pity. You declare.Evaluation. Mm-hmm. That's gonna be t problem. Yeah, well sure. Hi. Yeah, uh well, and as you saw, we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen. Well, these would be the main buttons, h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to. But, well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up. We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here. We have the sub-menus and stu stuff. We made a top oh, or a front view. Just so like you wanna uh back view. As you can see, this uh there, there are uh two uh weird bumps in it. This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic. And uh this is for the artistic effect. Well, what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that. But, idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two. And so when you put it on the table, it will just lay down. It won't uh roll around or stuff. But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe, or like these old uh phones. Y you you may get the idea. So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be. The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers, like we discussed early on. Uh, you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel, but more fluidly and round. Yeah. And uh, in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics uh that would you can make a more thinner uh design, and that would actually look very nice, yeah. And uh, about the colour, what have Yeah, f uh, as colours, do you do you have the picture in uh Oh yeah. Now, well this is the idea about uh the bumps. Uh, you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior. It uh you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us. Yeah, it's like an e but this is for children. We we want a more adult version. But, this is like a remote control for children.. A weemote. Yeah. Hey, that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand. Uh, but So this actually basic the idea. We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this. And and for colours, we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey. Those are the technological colours actually, so it d Or blue or whatever. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, maybe yeah, perhaps you're right. Uh, I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical. Nah. Yeah. Yeah, li like like this like this. This isn't this isn't too much, is it? I f Yeah. The buttons, I Yeah, uh something like this would be nice. Okay, that's that's it from us. Uh-oh. Why? Yeah, it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty. It's also designed for people above forty. So I have I've Yeah, two or three, because it's not just uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty. But it's also designed for people of age above forty. So, I'll say it's about three. Yeah, I I think Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Leads to user face, yeah. Yeah, false. Uh, hmm. Yeah, the they are big and clear.. Yeah, but but the teletext button. Yeah, you can ch That's in a menu. So, it's w yeah, it it it it isn't entirely unclear, but So, I wouldn't give it a seven. I would give it a more a five or a six. Uh, I don I don't know. What do you think, uh Mister Project Manager? Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape. So, if you so if you have trouble finding it Well, then uh then I'll go for four. Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false. Uh, so I'll I'll go for four. Wha Yeah, that that's a better question actually. Well, if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere, uh then you'd uh recognise it as, whoa, that is strange. Yeah. Yeah, what is that. Uh, so it's Yeah. Yeah, rubber, is kind of soft. Well, I don yeah, it is kind of It No. Uh It could yeah. Functional ability.. No, it's it I I'll go for two. My vote's on two. Yes. Yes, it Yeah, they are built in. Not down. You really like the parental advisory. Bu Yeah, he made it. No. Me, too. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, n no. No. Yes. No. Uh, we have one. We have one. No, sev zero. Well, that's um yeah, speech recognition and s A zero. No. No. Yeah. Just go on. Then we'll see uh we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget. Zero. I don't think so. No, this is a standard colour. Yes, this is a special colour. That's an add-on. No. These three. Well, we're only four Euro over budget. But Well, other case, we can make it single-curved or uncurved. Yeah. Okay, sure. Yeah, sure. Okay, well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved. And that would solve the budget problem. Yeah. It's just yeah well, the single-curve that Yeah. Exactly, yeah. We going to cut Yeah, we just make it flat. But, you do l Function. Worth, does it have added worth? No, um Yeah, well let's assume it is. We we should assume it i that it is. But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion. R if you uh promote a kinetic um I kinetic remote control, I mean, that would b sell better than an a normal remote control. No, well, y I mean uh, y you can go into your neighbour and tell him, ha, my k uh remote control is kinetic. You have standard old battery control uh remote con True. It is possible, but you can't use double uh curves for titanium. That's one of the functionability uh Well, I th I think you two, uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel, you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project. 'Cause I think m I think Jeroen and I, we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two. Ha. Nah, the leadership wasn't crappy, it was the leader that was crappy. Nah. No, the leadership was okay. Yeah, it was good. Try to learn from your mistake. And we will never do it again. Yeah, that went w it went well. It's it's just uh Nah. Yeah, we we had some trouble with the pen, but Yeah, but us Yeah. Oh. No, I have it working. But, uh yeah, well uh No, it doesn't have that much added value to the Yeah. Know what I mean. Or text function. Just t t type text, and that that would be uh excellent. Mean Oh. But uh, problem is, well you can't discuss anything well you you ca uh you can, but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now. We I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three. But, well uh I we said uh, no I w th think two, because this and this, and then you can react uh on it. But if you you put a three on it, uh just figure well, everybody knows what I'm knowing, so they'll all just put a two on. Yeah, but it would yeah. Yeah okay, the for processing part. But then uh, I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it, that uh isn't that bad idea, actually. Not that your opinion isn't valued, but but still. Yeah, sure. Y yikes. Seventy five pages. So you you finished it actually, and so we just have to read it and say yes or no? It's not double. Uh, it's not double anymore, eh? Yeah, okay. Yeah. On thing uh One small thing uh, the added functions. Uh, was it included in the cost? I don't think so, eh? It's very cheap. Okay, um hereby is the meeting is finished.Yo. Evaluation criteria. Oops. Some creative uh Oh. Yeah. Ok okay. Shall I give a short introduction and then uh Okay. J_ and J_, okay. Take it away. Um, this was our first concept. We decided to use a single touch-screen. So, we've worked out this concepts, how to how to hold it, where to put the buttons and and stuff. And um, well, we began with uh with a form of shape, that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand, left or right handed. So, we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some ar artistic meaning. No? This uh isn't nothing. Idea maybe uh is better. Um well, during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top, usable with your thumb, and uh the menu structure, uh if necessary, with your other hand, so it's just gonna hold it easily. And it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too, of course. So we began uh working out a concept. Yeah, the panel just uh of course goes like this. But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, we added that this um can be held with your hands for this maximum is om yeah, one and a half centimetres. So, you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips. S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable, so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple, but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control, it would be less appealing than a white one. And young people, we think, are a little bit more flexible, they think, ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh Well, um I think a cover is necessary, 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen. So, there must be some cheap standard cover, um maybe white or something, that's could comes with it and you can buy, so we can make extra money. Okay. The other way around, you mean. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, yeah. Well yeah, a colour of a wood style, a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours. And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour, but not too not too much. This is banana and mango, not not purple or p orange and yellow. Ah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, okay. No. Yeah. Okay. Okay. It's my turn. Mm. Yeah. No no, a little more in the middle. No, uh three or yeah. Yeah, it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty, but also appealing to Yeah. It's Wow. Yeah, it's the marketing uh angle on television. We have a wonderful Yeah. Well, it's also fancy then. Yeah. Of course. We have a perfect remote. Yes. Yeah yeah, oh they have to agree but I'm the User Interface uh Expert. Um, uh no. You you've different menu. And volume is impo yeah. Yeah yeah, big and clear. But you could make a teletext button uh six. Otherwise, the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button. No. Yeah. Black and red. Okay, don't forget to save it. Uh Uh well, when we put in fancy colours, yeah and Yeah. But, um it it's not making any sound uh, have we deciding? So It'll make a difference. We have the better re I don't know. Yeah, I think so. My remote control's black. A little bit, but yeah. Uh K yeah. Fo fo yeah fo five is. Yeah, okay, you're right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer, uh you find it, yeah? Yeah, that's stupid. Uh, but when you lost it you're just not Yeah, mostly when you lose your remote control, it it's under your Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it. Uh Um I would call uh choose two, 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours, as it would not. Um, kinda soft, but but not this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah, easy to use, very afford. No, you can do two, because um it can be easier. But then you're l yeah, but then you'll lose function f yeah, functionality and our fancy uh look, so. But It is r it is rather easy to use, because you have the primary buttons always visible. No. Yeah, m mine too. Yeah, but waits just a minutes. Inspiration. These are the m regular remotes. Yes, true, one. Yes, one. Very multifunctional. No. This is used with speech recognition, this. Yes. But uh, maybe make it two, because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh it's not an entire game. Yeah, okay. Yes. Th did you make this or the Yeah, It changes it maybe. Oh yay. Oh dear. Hmm? If they're under twelve fifty. Yeah? Cau 'cause so it's okay. Battery, yes. One. One, yeah. Kinetic, one. Yeah. No. No, the advanced chip is uh Yeah. Yeah, you give it a sample, uh one. No. You no. Yeah, 'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the uh the back of the Uh, we don't have anything else. So Could you step a little to the right ma Yeah. Oh, sorry. Or And zero. Special uh is the special colour? Mm. Yeah. Yeah, if if you're honest, we'll uh type one, special colour. Yeah. Uh, j maybe we'll finish uh the the list first and then look back, aye? No. Scroll wheel, no. No. One, yeah. No. Mm, is it No. No. So No. No. Mm, single-curves. Yeah. Just cut off the kine yeah. Or yeah. Yeah, we just put a good battery it it. Mobile phones nowadays. But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway, just you s you have to recharge them manual. Yeah, that's a cost reduc Ah. Yeah, so we have to bake the ba back flat, and then No, it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think. Or Or are these two curves? Uh Yeah, but what else uh do we have to cut out? No advanced chip, uh that's a little bit of problem. Although, can we make it with a regular chip? Curvy. Explanation. Twelve fifty. Well Yeah, but does it fit with our design? Do we have to u adapt it? It's single-curves. W Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back, and then we're uh has Okay. More. Yeah. You make it optional. Functional. Uh, there's an a a athe aesthetic value, but not functionality. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile. So You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version. Yeah. Yeah, just one big curve. Uh, this uh American figures. You just cut down some trees. Whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium. Yes. No. We sue. We Yeah, we'll start her all o all over again. Um For us, there was a lot of creativity. We could just sign up an uh remote if we liked. Uh Crappy. Cra Yeah. Yeah, example of crappy leadershi Okay, yeah. You could of said, shut up you fool. Yeah, more more consensus. Ev everybody w was agreeing every Yeah. Well, we work together on a project, but everybody has his own task. So, it is a little bit Yeah. No Well, it went okay. Stupid stupid pen, but uh Yeah, but but draw something uh difficult. D uh just write your name right now. Try to write your name, in in writing letters, of course, yeah? Yeah, normally, uh this uh the w Block letter sign it, yeah? Just just write your name in in one line. If it's a little bit too small bit quicker now. It didn't Uh he he knows how it works, yeah. Y well, yeah. Th the i The idea is great, but it doesn't work properly. Uh Yeah. Nee. As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago, it I would like, myself, to write with a normal pen, because must um Yeah, it's almost the same concept, but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner. I it's the same concept as the pen, where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow. Yes. No, and it doesn't give any added value. Yeah, not user-friendly. Yeah, and it's it's not very precise. We're trying to m to Yeah, it may um Yeah, and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size, yeah. Smaller. Yeah, smaller. Just like when you're writing on a letter. No, a as you saw on on this drawing, just open open this one or that one. It's uh th it it Yeah, uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons, it's almost impossible to get clear uh when you're uh And the eraser was another problem. It w t is is this large. And when you try to erase this line, y I'm gonna erase my name there. M Abo What kind of new ideas? Yeah, uh New ideas about uh the working of this software, about about the project, about the remote controls or Hello. Yeah. So true. Not really, just they have to improve it. Uh, the concept is okay, but it has to be quicker. Uh, it is still opening my programme, n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process and it, yeah, just takes too many time. People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it, and More user-friendly. 'Cause when you use a pen, you can just draw like you d draw normally, and you do Yeah. Yeah, that l Would be easier. Or at least when you you don't have to adapt to the technology, just you can write in the way you normally write. And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen. And that's a very bad concept. Nah, okay, I I it's my opinion that I Yeah, it's can be saved easier. But if you're in normal flip-over you a lot of people write text. There's no text option. And writing text uh, yeah, you've gotta really do your best to write some Yeah. Or maybe even insert picture. If you have uh some presentation, and you have some f Yeah.

The project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda. The user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design, describing the shape and layout of the remote. The group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours, but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers. The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product. The group calculated the production costs. The group were 4 euros over budget, so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy. The project manager led the evaluation of the project process. The group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team. It was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings. The group were also had problems with the digital pens. The group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting. 
14	Is that for us? Okay. Yeah, shall I show? I'll show. Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and I'll I'll show you the presentation. Can I just nick your Whoa. Going a bit crazy over here. Thank you. Okay, so this is our look and feel presentation, the final our final presentation. And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there. Um It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour, either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something. This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached, but we can we can come up with that. Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it. Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say, it's yeah yeah, it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat. Yeah, yeah. And working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually, thinking about it now, could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well, so that you could probably get a bit of Yeah. Yeah. Um we decided that um the voice recognition system, it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. So you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where where is the remote and it'll shout back, I'm here, or something. And then yeah. It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something. It'll just shout out I'm here, or something to similar effect. Uh yeah, if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time, maybe. You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is. Um the standard, there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about. Um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers, it would need two separate P_C_B_s, so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling. And uh because, obviously, all T_V_s use this, the same infrared medium, we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data. And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer, just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on. Yeah, yeah, something like that. Yeah, on the front on the front side of that, yeah. So when you've actually got it open, it would be facing the T_V_. And then finally um on to the interface. The top screen, as we said, is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it, uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons, like the vo volume up and down, channel up and down, power on and off, and uh things to that effect. And now we've we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top. No d not not actually. No, not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing. And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics, as that is that's the company logo. There you go.. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah, two or three. No, three. Three. Mm yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'd give it a one. No, no, not at all. Yeah. Two. Two. Yeah. D_. One. Yeah. Yeah, that's No, no, the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue, but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised. Yeah, yeah, yeah and No, no, 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it, that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic. Yeah, I'll give it a one as well. Yeah. Mm. No. Yeah. It's meant to be. Yeah. Yeah, I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five, actually, 'cause Yep. Yeah. Yeah, it was it was uh a voice voice recognition, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that yeah, that's feasible. Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand it would be quite loud. So it would be s p yeah. Yeah. Yeah, one. I do realise that we might be being fairly biased, 'cause it is our product, but W I thin yeah, I think yeah. Mm. No. Yeah. It was a regular chip on print and Oh, no, no, no, the um Yeah, it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells, there should just be one. In the top, it's the number of c yeah. Yeah, and yeah, just a no, one reg v uh Yeah, one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker. And they're double curved. No. Y Two, 'cause it's two. Yeah, I'd say I'd say it was w yeah, I think I think it's One double-curved. And one no, 'cause one yeah, one's double-curved, and then the other one's a plastic. Yeah. And special colour. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, that's it's as an extra. So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there, because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get. Yeah, okay. Yeah, the push-button's one and L_C_ display one. And buttons Well yes. Yeah. No, we'll have No, no, you've got to click off to calculate it again. C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros. It could be in Dollars. And then it would be fine, because the exchange range would make it about twelve. No. Yeah, the standard, it um it would make one difference. The biggest one would be taking away if you took away If you to Yeah. If if you take away the voice, I I do I don't like to say it, but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. Yeah i yeah. No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker. If you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five. They n n yeah, but you p minus three plus two. Yeah. But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product. Yeah. We c we could s Yeah, we could say Yeah, I s And then say we recommend Yeah. Yeah. That'll do it. Twelve point three five. Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty? Ah. Okay. Yeah. No. 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra, you could just take that out and that would be fine, yeah. Yeah, I think that's brilliant. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I'd say, as a team. Yeah. Find out from each other, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, I thought it it went really well and I yeah, I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out, although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good. I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would've come out a d little different, but yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, well. Discuss which ones yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more, had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Vegetables. Yeah. No. Yeah, I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned. They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player, does anyone remember the remote control? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one? Yeah, just jazz it up a bit. Uh d they don't really think about it, because normally, the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship. They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player, the video player, the T_V_. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Well. I think that was just the the physical. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think yeah I don't from the market research. No. Yeah, it was I it's top secret. Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here. That's what it is. In your yeah. Okay. Is that it then? Awesome. Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing? I don't think. Yeah, the the s yeah. I think yeah, questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting. Mm.Is that someone's? Okay. Or something. Well done. Certainly. Logged in? Thank you. Oops. Okay. This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research. So this is the first stage of the evaluation. Now, the collection of the criteria, as we saw in our previous meeting, was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company. So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting, are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? Now the findings that we came up with, just a recap, are here. The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use, it should incorporate current fashion trends, and those the two main ones, they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours. The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, but there was also, on the sideline, the though of maybe having a beeper function. Okay, so we can come back to that slide, if you don't have a note of those. I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this, to what we have so far. We're going to use a seven point scale, where one is true and seven is false. We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned, I'll call that slide back up, and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here. Does that seem clear? Any questions there? So we're going to look at these crite Yes, we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven. Is that okay? One is true, seven is false. Right. So I won't write all of that out again. It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or A_, B_, C_, D_, E_, F_ to confuse it with the number rating. B_, C_, D_, E_, F_. This is where I realise how tiny I actually am. Criteria and rating. Actually, it might be an idea, if we each did give our own individual rating, and we could take an average at the end. How about that? Okay. So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques, and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's who. Okay. Criteria A_, the fancy look and feel. How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel. One is true, seven is false. My own rating for that would be a two. One is true and seven is false. I'll just go this way. Two. Okay. Two. A four, okay. Adding those up, we've got a six and a five, eleven divided by four is what? Uh two and three quarters, it that right. Two and three quarters? Okay. Two point seven five, there we go. Okay, criteria B_, criterion B_, technologically innovative. I would give that a three. Okay. Not that you're biased in that it the designer. The average oh, for you? You want your rating to be a two? Is that what you're saying? Okay. So, I'll work out the average for that again at the end. It's a very slightly altered Okay, and we're just waiting for your rating f Two point five, okay. Losing one decimal place, that's okay. So what are you rating for this one, Paw? Two, okay. So that is eight. That brings it down to two, nice and simple, yeah. Okay, ease of use. Easy to use? Based on what you've said there, I would say a one, true. Two. A two, okay. Two. I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy, shouldn't I? We'll just put almost two, because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places. Okay. Or we or if we want to really bring it down, we can do later. Um mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends, now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours. Right. So I'm just thinking, before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here. Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use? Right. So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do. Okay. And the spongy feel is no problem with that. Okay. In that case it's got to be a one for me. Yep. Everybody? Okay. That part was nice and easy. Okay. Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury. I don't think we've really touched on that a lot. We've we've discussed it, we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that. We've talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you're someone who's zapping, who's sitting like that, and we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four. A five, okay. Four and a four okay. Twenty one is that twenty one? So that's four point two five. And finally, last but not least, easy to locate. Now we talked about voice recognition, we talked about a beeper, have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that? It was the I'm here thing, yep. And are we happy with the costs on that? That is going to be feasible, cost-wise. That sounds good then. I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that, just as we could volume on T_V_. So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms, or. Right. Okay. You built into the feature. Okay. Logical. That's a one for me. One and one, good. So, how do we feel about this? We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there. That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate. The lowest rating we've got, which is really n it's not terribly low, i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury. Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modifications? We happy to go ahead? Yeah. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that. I know. Okay. Well, I hope that's uh clear to the team. Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up? Good. Fine then. I'll just leave it there. Oops. Oh yes. Yes. But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit. So it can rest. It would just be a flat bottom with one curve. like a domed thing. Mm. The other curves at the sides, but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over. Yeah. What does it mean if you put point five for that? Mm-hmm. Right, okay. But it is gonna be part of the total cost, and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in, is there? There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing. So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there? Okay. Mm. Might do, if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours. S Has that not made any d if you click off that square now, has that not made any difference? Is it oh, it's brought it slightly down. So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing, is that going to make a difference? Oh, it's not made any difference, has it?. It's gone up again. Oh. It's brought it down slightly. Is there anything on the menu No. If we tr um. If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference? And people are used to buying batteries, they're not gonna say I'm not getting this, 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control. Should we see what difference it makes? Um Yeah. Sure. But we're still working to um head o We can put in our recommendations. If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. But we need to work to that specification to start with. And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful, but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance. Um as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so Mm. Yeah. 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it. Yeah. So if we take voice recognition out we are. Are you sure? Sorry, not meaning to doubt your words there. Right. Are they really going to quibble about ten P_? Or point zero one of a Euro? Which is less than ten P_. That's today's kick off meeting,. Mm. I thought that's what it was. So we're okay. Although we had our separate tasks, there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to um bounce off each other. And I've certainly felt heard, listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take and adjust our remit where necessary. Yeah. Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line. And fake R_C_s. How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information? Could it've been better, was it adequate? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. It's really borrowing from other areas, it's, you know, bringing things from other areas in, it so it's I mean nothing is new, but it's applying it to a d in a different area. Absolutely, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the focus isn't on to that, yeah. I think it's really good that this has been very market research based, because just going back to mobile phones, I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really, you know, say is is obvious and visible. We see it in mobile phones a lot, and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from. There are innovations in that that people don't really want. I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with, and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake, and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based. Yeah. But forcing it onto people, yeah. It's things that, you know, they might want to buy the thing they really want. Mm. Mm. Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever, yeah. See I think I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone. Mm-hmm. But I think in the remit that we were given, it was very specific. I think we've done what we were required to do, and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things. I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for. I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that I think people are really gonna want. I know. Maybe it will. Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it. Mm-hmm. Questionnaire. Questionnaire done. Oh, I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time. Oh, right. But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too? Yeah.If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time. Is that. three, apparently. Okay, you all switched on. I presume we're good to go. Okay, um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger, standard chip, um 'cause it can come in various different sizes, it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor. We wanted a stand-by function. The case material is gonna be soft, rubbery, changeable. Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design. Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit, keeping with the hip kind of feel. Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that. Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_. Okay? Prototype presentation. I think that would be you. Make sure the camera's Yes, yes you can. Wait a second, I'll get it out. Um Okay. You should have one of those things and you can just take it off. Ta-da. Right. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. So it's flush. Oh right, okay, yeah. So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections, 'cause it's the top part that's okay. Okay. I'm under the sofa. Or, that would be too complicated. Infrared. Like here. Okay. Actually, no, it would be it would have to be on the on the front. Oh right, yeah, okay, yeah, I've got you. It's still pointing, yes. Yeah, that would make sense. Okay. But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product once it's Okay. Thank you very much. Wrapping it all up, okay. Um I've now got evaluation criteria. It's to be presented. Okay. It's quite similar to what it was before, though. Sorry. Mm-hmm. Okay. Just write small. Yeah. That works. Mm-hmm. I would agree. Okay. I would say two. A two. It's just two point five for that one. I would say a two. I would say a two. One point seven f five. Okay, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. One. Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half, the material, minimises R_S_I_ it's meant to. Um maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small, but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much. So maybe because there's more space, it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between. It's quite obvious just big buttons. Um Four. A standard. It would be. And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in, then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room, you'd go into another room. One. I don't think so. I think we yeah. I think we're set. Do much apart from having a huge big Don't think so. Okay, thank you. Okay, I've got finance here now. I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it, if that's okay. Um. Thanks. Right. Now I presume that the screen will go blank, that um Okay. We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value. So are we still on for kinetic? Okay. See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. Um it might have influenced our choice. Right, what's happening with the electronics? Double-curved. Oh, right, okay. Thanks. So, would there be two? One chip. Okay. One double curve. So what's a single curve then? So just one double Yeah. Um Mm. Um we've got plastic and rubber, haven't we?. Um Do you think? Okay. It would be like saying we're using See, it says case material. So we're not actually using plastic in the case, are we? It's including, it's including. Okay, we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half. Or sh we should just put it in as one, because the plastic is zero anyway. No, we don't step on anyone's toes. Okay, special colour, do we need that? N yeah, okay. Interface. Buttons Has that not gone up? Oh no, it was seven five it's changed not a lot. Oh, it's not calculated it. Okay, there we go. It's not a lot though. We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though, I think Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here. Um and the interface. Where's the where's the voice recognition? Right, okay. Well the kinetic is three. If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three. Oh, right. I keep seeing zero. Um We can do it some other way, we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition. We could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version. You could choose to have that or not. So should we just change the design specification then? Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, we can make the price fit, and then say if we'd had our budget, we would've had this, because it also sets it apart from the crowd. They like their gadgets, they like something that's completely different. It's s something completely different associated with your company. Right, okay, so It's two point five. No, it's twelve point two five. Yeah well two, twelve point two five times two is twenty five, isn't it? I think the agenda one was where the um price was, wasn't it? No. Twelve point five. Well done, people. So is that uh got us covered for the electronics then? We don't need something else to take that place? Okay. Okay. Right, so we've done that. Okay. Product evaluation. We've done room for creativity, haven't we? Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make. Um I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork. um in the sense that um did you feel like a team? Or did you feel like uh autonomy? Mm-hmm. Thank you. How did you find it? Yeah. Yeah. I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like shot down, you know, y it didn't matter it saying what you thought, because if it wasn't something that was that relevant, then it didn't matter, 'cause it was just another idea in the field. I like that. Um teamwork. Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model. Um uh I'm still not caught up. But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all. Um Maybe. No, that was quite fun. Um means, whiteboard, digital pens, etcetera, what does that mean? Any ideas? Had time to kind of Yeah, 'cause we could just sort of say, sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that, rather than having to email it, yeah. But it was nice having it there. Um like the whole picture of the thing. Yeah, I think it's new ideas in general, rather than Mm. Yeah, no. Well they have to come from somewhere, don't they? And as sh as w sorry, you go. Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, remote controls, no one's thought about it particularly. I mean they're slightly different, so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's, 'cause it's w something we should think about, but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it. Mm. But then when it everything is really smart, and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table, it doesn't go, I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing, a funky item that's individual, individual to you, I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic, you would pray you would pay a lot extra, because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you. But people could have anything that they wanted. Because of the produ Mm. Yes. Yeah. Well, it's innovation for money's sake. The the people have to keep buying. Yeah. And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine, but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone, because the phones have moved on, things like that. Yes. It's madness. Um In closing There we go. Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased, but I think I don't know, d what do you think? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing? And the heating for the building, do you think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out? So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit, you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that. So maybe increasing it, you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at. But I think but you were saying that that's quite Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. It's a shame it won't ever get made. Maybe it will. Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it. Um the project has been evaluated well and truly. Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire. Oh, so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with, so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor, so good luck. I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds. Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks. Oh. Um yeah, just the last, I think. I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy. I just got conHmm. Thank you. Hmm. Hmm. Yep, me too. Mm-hmm. Yep. Me and William worked on a prototype, and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that. Yeah. I can hold it like Yeah, so It looks crazy. Um not now. Oh. Yeah. Oh, where are the hinges? 'Kay. You able to look? Yep.. The black and white touch screen wherein people can Right. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Ah oka Infrared could be here also. Yeah, here.. So when it's even if it's open here, the signals would go. Yeah. This one right here.. Which is No. Look up to it. Yay. So this is the one. Sorry. Evaluation.. Mm um I I think this is chip. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah, it's perfect. Is it everybody is going to evaluate, or just the Market okay. 'Kay. Yeah, so you can 'Kay. I would say four. Mm-hmm. Almost three. I think yeah. Oh sorry, I I got it wrong. The first one rating, I'm sorry. Can you just make it two? The first. Yeah, I I just it the other way. Uh in Yep, I just got two point f One is a, seven is false, okay. Two. Two. White. With for the plastic? Uh blue. Any Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case. One. Mm. Four. Voice r recognition. Hmm. You want me to b unplug that? That's all. Yes. Okay. Chip on print. Okay. Yep. Single-curved. Two curves, yeah. Single-cu. Plastic and rubber. Yeah. Plastic one and maybe rubber point five. No I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, we can put point five. Yeah, because there are I think it allows the point five, yeah. We can use that. It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually. We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic. Push-button. One. An One. I think we could change the battery also. Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery. Uncurved, flat. No, it just surprises one.. I don't think so. Ri I think it's in Euro. And going to a regular bat Yeah. What I feel is, customers never said anything about the battery. It's internal, nobody looks into the battery. But shape and colours, that's something we shouldn't comprimi Where's that special form? Mm mm mm. Mm-hmm. Make it costly. Yeah we are close to the budget. Two five. It's twelve point five maybe, then. I don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost. So half of the price would be I think it is the first one. So we are under the budget. Seems fine. Except voice recognition, everything is Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think we had a nice time. Yeah, I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody. It's not like people trying to cut each other. There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork. We came to a very predic creative design, yeah. Yeah, and uh Yeah, I think. And Sarah, you coordinated the work very well. Yeah. I think that was the best part of the 'Kay. Yeah, moving around the room. But I think it's good, like uh we spent times individually. I never thought of a remote control with a flip top. That's mine. Yeah, it's The thing is Yep, sorry, go on Sarah. Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones, like a real want to see a new launch or something like that. And new f television products coming up, but nobody giving uh much idea to this. Like Sarah was telling, everything's Right. Mm-hmm. Maybe fifty percent more. Yeah. Who knows? Yeah. There's a final questionnaire. Celebration, you didn't talk about that. Yeah.@highlightThe Project Manager went over decisions from the previous meeting.@highlightThe Industrial Designer presented the prototype and discussed its look, its internal components, and its interface.@highlightThe Marketing Expert evaluated the product according to the initial product goals.@highlightThe group then decided that enough of this criteria had been satisfied for the project to continue.@highlightThe Project Manager presented the final cost of the device which exceeded the initial projected price point.@highlightThe group decided to remove speech recognition but to propose to the management that it  remain in the design.@highlightThe group then discussed their effectiveness as a team.@highlightAll members felt that they interacted well and that they felt they could be creative.@highlightThe Marketing Expert felt that the market-research based approach would help the project's success with consumers.@highlightThe group did express, however, that the budget was overly constraining.@highlightThe Project Manager instructed the group to fill out a final evaluation questionnaire.

15	Hmm hmm hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yep, yep. Okay. Tu tu tu tu Hi, good morning. 'Kay. Oops. Mm. Oh sorry. Mm-hmm. Yeah, me. Cat. Where did this come from? Uh, yep. Thank you. Uh, maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make? Yep. It's actually sitting, so it's sitting, it's not standing. Okay, I see it as one thing it's very supportive. It's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog, it can be your best friend, it doesn't discriminate between you, based on what you are. Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition. dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog. Thank you. Okay. Sorry. Does it look like a dog actually? Mm. Eagle, okay. One point four or something like that. One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that. Yeah. Okay, pretty huge margin. So then Mm-hmm. Yeah, that c Okay, you wanna integrate everything into one like Okay. So simplification of symbols you could think of. Mm-hmm. Menu, alright. Uh uh Right, I was thinking on the same lines you, instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user, may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that, like a mobile, yeah and with menus. And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe. You mean to save it lesser number. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm, okay. S It might it might save a b bit of space, it's i instead of looking bulky, it might look small. But it might have its cost implications. Right. Okay. Mm, yeah.Are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better? Okay, that's fine. Am I supposed to be standing up there? Okay. Yeah, I've got Yes. Okay. Hello everybody. Um I'm Sarah, the Project Manager and this is our first meeting, surprisingly enough. Okay, this is our agenda, um we will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other. Um then we'll go do tool training, talk about the project plan, discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that, as far as I can understand. Now, we're developing a remote control which you probably already know. Um, we want it to be original, something that's uh people haven't thought of, that's not out in the shops, um, trendy, appealing to a wide market, but you know, not a hunk of metal, and user-friendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches should be able to use it. Okay, um, first is the functional design, um this is where we all go off and do our individual work, um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that. Um, conceptual design, what we're thinking, how it's gonna go and then the detailed design, how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work. Okay, right. We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board, I'll go first, and um sum up the characteristics of that animal. So Okay, I'll leave space for everyone else. Um What's missing? We're running out of blue. Okay. I'm not gonna ask you to guess, I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger. And I see them as majestic, and independent, and proud. Now, who would like to go next? 'Kay. Is that your lapel then? There you go. Okay, thank you. Okay. Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today is um Gonna be a bird. Is it gonna be it's gonna be a bird. That's lovely. Okay it's fine. Technical help. Hmm. Okay, yeah. A seagu right, not a seagull. Eagle. Mm-hmm. That's lovely. Okay. That was fun, right. Um finance-wise, we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros, which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds, at all. Any ideas? D fifteen? Seventeen. Okay, that's expensive. I think so, I think so, I'll be able to um pull it up, or I could put it in the shared folder or something. Really? Mm. I think Yeah, um production cost's at twelve fifty, so half of the selling price is taken up by building it. Um, and profit aim is fifty million Euros, which is uh Yi yes, um yeah, I presume so. Um Mm-hmm. No, yeah. So yes, yes, I don't think we have to I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that, um making that a key point, just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia, America, things like that. Okay. What are your experiences with remote controls? I mean I've got we got um we had three videos, a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls, um that you programme each of your things into, but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again. I think it was quite a cheapie as well, so that might have had something to do with it, but that was quite good, the fact that you could You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you. Mm. Yeah, the main that's the main stuff anyway, I mean and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that. Yeah. Um. When they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording, things like that inside it. 'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at, it's obvious what you're doing, um. What about the older generation? What about granny and grandads? Um, my grandad can answer his mobile phone, but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that. I don't think they tape things, I don't think they use Mm, yeah, the age gap. Mm. I don't know, I d I don't like the, you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system. I find it really confusing, I kept getting lost in the phone, I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost, but that's just me. Yeah. Teletext has got that option as well. Yeah. Or what about kind of a dual function? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play, volume, programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures, obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that. Mm-hmm. I think that's a cost thing, I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about Yes, no that's important. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Um, right, okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting, so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things. Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation. Sure. Okay. Mm. I would it would probably. I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything. They're kind of moulded and look a bit different, and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic, which looks a bit smarter, so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about. Okay, so let's break it up there. Okay? So, see you in half an hour. I think so, yeah.So we've got both of these clipped on? She gonna answer me or not? Right, both of them, okay. God. Jesus, it's gonna fall off. A kind of dog? Sorry? Uh. Mm-hmm. Please, please leave me a space at the bottom, I'm little, you can get to the top, with standing on a chair. I think it's outstandingly good. Crocodile? O Beauti that's Okay. Um, I'm very impressed with your artistic skills, mine's are dreadful. Oops this is now coming apart, let me just put the top in. I hope that clicks in, I'll just I'll hold it on, okay. Oops, oh dear, what happened there? Hopefully that'll stay on, two-handed version. Okay, uh Again this is off the top of my head, I was gonna do a big cat too, um. Oh dear, it doesn't look what like what I want it to be. Uh. It's not a vampire bat honestly. Uh and somewhere there's a body behind. That's my dreadful that's the worst yet, that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull, I never thought of a seagull. An eagle, um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness. I suppose they're all so independent, I'd put that one down again. Da dum um. Indepen independent, right, did you say they're good at golf? Are they? Oh. Oh right, okay, I'm not good at golf. I'd say they're quite free-spirited, flying around everywhere, doing their own thing. And uh, birds of prey aren't they, oh dear, intrepid. I'll put that, intrepid. There we go, hope that pen's gonna be okay. Whoops. Seventeen. Seventeen Pounds. Should we be making notes of this? We can just refer to this later can't we? Yeah, okay. Okay. Right. So so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price, we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option? Mm. Mm-hmm. In our first year? Mm-hmm. You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market, any particular thing, it's everyone user-friendly to everyone. Okay. Big target group. No. Mm. Alright. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy, not doing any tampering with it and programming, using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things. But basically on, off, volume up and down, channel one, two, th that basic functions, I don't think I could go any further with it than that, so, I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. And symbols that you don't necessarily understand, symbols you're meant to understand that you don't. Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Actually that just raises a point, I wonder what our design people think, but you know on a mobile phone, you can press a key and it gives you a menu, it's got a menu display, I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful, so you've got a little L_C_D_ display. With menus, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too? Right. Right. So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with, that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps, and that's another issue how we tackle that. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books? Obviously it displays less on the screen, it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. The other thing is, just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again, it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top, your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, like smaller. And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone, it can still be lightweight plastic, you know? Something that's easily moulded and produced. Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys. Ah right. Okay. Sure b y yeah. But yeah, I mean it doesn't have to be that, you know th that was my main point, we don't have to use metal, I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper, I presume it would. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Okay. 'Kay. Do we go back to our room? Yep?It's sitting down. Yeah I'll have a go. Thanks. Alright, okay. Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do, I'll have to have to go for something a bit random. And also, my drawing skill isn't that great so, yeah. Okay, now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now, so. Yeah, it can be a crocodile, it can be a crocodile. Well it was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually. Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is. Um uh scary, uh strong, yeah that's about it I think. Uh uh Wo Hmm. Okay. Uh S Uh Okay, some sort of bird. Ah eagle, right okay. They're good at golf. Yeah, no yeah, an eagle. It's about mm, mm yeah. Yeah, yeah, something like that, so that yeah about seventeen, seventeen Pounds, something like that. But Havi having said that though, if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway. So, it'd still be yeah, we had to buy one. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah uh. Use all the ones at the same time. Yeah, 'cause you Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext, so. Yeah. Yeah, what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing, 'cause I mean, menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do. But I don't know how Oh yeah. Yeah, I don't I don't know how for twenty fi, or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get, you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway, I'd assume. Y Yeah. No uh uh Yeah. Just just a quick thing about the um about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable? The sort of I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics, so I think think the whole design thing might be qui I mean you don't you you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

16	Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm Robin. I'm the Marketing Manager. Mm-hmm, okay. I dunno. Your microphone's just Yeah. I don't know. We can have have a whole menagerie. Right. Hello. Um I'm gonna go for the dog, and I'm gonna draw one badly as well. Uh. looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something. Right. There's my dog. Um I like dogs because they're very loyal. And they're always happy, so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired, they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited. So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog. And they're also good for exercise as well. You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired. And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well, so. Okay, that's why I like dogs. Great. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I've Okay. Yeah. Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well. 'Cause there's quite often lots and lots. And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room. So whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel, now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote. So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room. I don't know. That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television, but Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are, and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops. So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television, your stereo, and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well, maybe. Okay. If you just click return it should be okay. It'll get rid of the message. If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message. Oh you've got. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay cool. Okay cheers.I'm Louisa. I'm the User Interface Designer. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training. I don't mind. Um. Let's see. Good job I got pockets today. Are we supposed to do this right now, do you think, or? Oh. Right here we go. Okay. I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat. Little smiley cat there. Um and this would be because they're very independent, uh they're very intelligent, compared to dogs maybe. Um and they can be very very affectionate. Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats. Um. Um and they can look after themselves. Shall I rub that out, actually? That's quite good. Can I just check? Is this just a television remote? Because a lot of um systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now, or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined. And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house. So if you've got a combined system, it could be a combined remote. Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing? Comes to your whistle. I think that might be back to the start. Um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down? I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for. Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it? Right. Okay.Okay. I'm Nick. I am the Industrial Designer. Tool training. Yeah. Yes. Okay. You've lost uh your microphone there. Okay, yeah. I'll I'll Shall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything. Okay. There's one. Didn't think of that. 'Kay uh pens are over here. I'll try the red pen. Okay. Um. I'm gonna go for the bear which I'm be able to draw very well, but I'll have a bash at it. Uh. Ooh ooh I lost it there. I think I've just knocked the microphone. Um. We'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear. Um and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that. Great. Yes. Um I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons. As that is the main function. Yes. Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible. is easy to use and see. Yes. Sorry, you go. You go. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote. Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself, or sort of the instructions that would come with it? 'Kay. Or not. slide four Okay. Yes. 'Kay, yes. I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control, so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise. 'Kay. Okay, that's great.Right, so start of the first meeting. Uh. Right, so agenda of the first meeting. Where we uh We have twenty five minutes for this meeting. We uh are to get acquainted. So does everyone want to say who they are? that seem sensible? And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader. Alright okay, so tool training. Um. Project plan. So does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required? Neither am I. Oh I see, so we shouldn't really be Oh right okay, so. So we have the project team, which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device. Uh we have uh the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time. And uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one, and to to be trendier, to be with it, and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience. So um method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh the functional design, the conceptional design, and the detailed design. So um in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves, the designers of this uh this device. And uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before. And therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day. Um and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end. So we've got tool training. Try out whiteboard. Uh. So we will um. Right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there. I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works. So uh I don't know who wishes to go first. Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever. Ah uh. But now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera. I take it that I would I would guess so. Or Technical problems. I mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things. Next. I don't see as there's any need to. There's plenty of space. I mean whatever. Exactly. We've had more time to prepare over this side, so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets. The three pens are underneath. You get marks for artistic impression. So you're just doing the face. Right, um. Well I've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh I'm not too keen on them anyway. Not to worry. So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw. Uh As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well. Anyway um. And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever, you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you. Whereas if you got fish, you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh change the water every couple of months, and buy in a few plants, so. Other than the fact that they keep dying, uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance. Right. Okay, uh if we're still all with us. Right okay, so. Work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price. That information has come from our marketing manager here. So we're looking to sell internationally, not just in Europe. We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit. And therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit. And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time. So um Experience with remote control, first ideas. New remote. So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were. So uh any any thoughts? Okay, so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily. Um we're looking for a device that is uh What was the other things you said there? Easy to use. Use. And see. Okay. Uh. Mm-hmm. Oh I w um basically I'll get back to you on that. But it seems to me sensible, 'cause as you rightly said, there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room. And uh So a device for for all remotes. Hmm. But is it in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive. You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well, you want any idiot to be able to use it. Whilst at the same time you want, as you rightly said, one remote for all. And so these are probably mutually exclusive options that uh Hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes, therefore they're more with handling them, therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on. Better instructions. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting. So uh we have to uh start winding up. Um is there Next meeting in thirty minutes. So um Right, so we've got I_D_ the Come on, where's my Oh there we go. Yeah. That's what I was looking for. Right. So we've got function Oh what happened to the Right. Right. Sorry about that. Okay, so we've got um the working design for I_D_. For U_I_D_ the technical functions design. Marketing, the user requirement specification. Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach. So. Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes? And I guess I'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting. Television remote control. That's true, 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going. But at this point in time I think you're right that uh shall we make it just a T_V_. Okay? So we will depart. We will stay here and uh and break off. And I'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour. Okay.

The group introduced themselves and their roles to each other. The Project Manager introduced the project aim and agenda to the group. The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard. The Project Manager discussed the projected production cost and price point for the device. The group began a discussion about their own experiences with using remote controls and about usability features to be included in the design. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to prepare the working design, the User Interface Designer to research technical functions, and the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification. The group discussed the function of the prototype and decided that they should restrict the remote to television for the time being. 
17	Okay, is everybody ready? Mm-hmm. Um I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and um I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires. Yeah, mm-hmm. Okay. You're participant four. Okay, and now I can uh full screen. Uh, okay, okay. Uh okay, can can I at this point interject um something? Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered. Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext, because that's sort of outdated with the internet, and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_, mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things, and they are concerned with the time to market. Okay. Um and the and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product, so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company, and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out. So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at. These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things, so it's only gonna be T_V_, but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea. Mm 'kay. Okay. And uh who would be next, uh, I guess that would be you. Mm-hmm. You want me to get your slide show up? Mm-hmm. And you are number three? Number two. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah yeah, uh-huh. There, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yo and it's yeah but it's so. Yep. Yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated, so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now. Mm-hmm. Yeah I It just build a mould basically and uh you know. As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or Oh yes. I think I think we will have to look at the budget on that but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun, you know. Yeah. Silly for children. Like an animal or Yeah. Yeah, a little elderly, a little arthritic hand you know, and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it exactly you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated you know. Mm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh Mm-hmm. Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Holder, yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, you don't have to. This one? And Francine? You are number two? You're three. Would you want it full full screen? Mm-hmm? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. On the on on the remote. Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Yes. By your child, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Timer, yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Uh okay, now I have On my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda, and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that. However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group. And uh what function, working design, how how does it work. So these are the two things we should come up wit with. So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group. Um. I guess in many ways everybody. Everybody who has a T_V_. Yeah, and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_. There are a few but in general not. Now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups. We have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands, so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important. Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear. And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not. So this these are just some thoughts I have on it, and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes, whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups. Mm-hmm. That has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups. I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours. You know, like you make it nice and pink, fluorescent, banana colour or whatever you know yeah, for example you know. But the question is really, who is our target group. Do we look at one target group? And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect? Right. With with Mm-hmm. Well that's that's Yeah. No The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function, and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know, within the target group or subgroups. The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. I mean the basic design I understand will be the same, but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example. So that remains to s to be seen but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_. Yeah, well that's that's the question. Well maybe there's there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones? They have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever, and maybe something like that, that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package. And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately. You know, yes. That's right, and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package, then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know. Well I think I think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote and what the only change is gonna be um the funct d t yeah uh the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way, um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um Five minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message. Finish meeting now. Um um. But I think I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody. If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that. Do we agree, do we? Do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not. Okay? So now I understand it's lunch break. And um. So that's what we will do. So hank you very much. And we'll see you after lunch.Yes. Okay. Okay. What features. S sellable. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Receive. Multi-purpose. Eliminated. Mm-hmm colours. Yes exactly. Yes. Like a doll, or Yes. Yes. Okay. Something else. Channels. Yes. Yes. Mm yeah. Yes. Hmm. Okay. To keep the remote? Yeah. A case holder. A holder remote holder. Participant two. Yes. No no, I'm three. I can make it full? Yes yes yes. Okay. As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote. Yeah can you please go onto the next slide? So I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance. Now for that, uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_. There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it. Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice. Yes. Yes. So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time, and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time. So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel. And uh the uh the uh and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote. Uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television. And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability. And uh and uh and it is one more point which I noted it down, like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person. And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock, and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote. Yes, and as John Reece said the buttons can be, uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently. So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel. And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote, he uh he should not be harmed in any way. And findings, uh I found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used, there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities, there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are uh So uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television. Next slide. And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use. Not, uh no uh like it can it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock, and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that. And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically, so that nobody else comes later and use it. Timer. Yeah and then you can use a timer as well. Yes. Yeah that's it. Okay. T_V_ television we was. Mm-hmm. Different colours. Yes. Okay. No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems, yes. But in a family in a family there will be a aged person, children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes. They would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh Cost effective. Okay. Yes. Okay. Um Yes. But uh yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people. Okay. Of th okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, mm-hmm. Yes. Okay.Yeah I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you. Okay? Okay you want me to start right now? Okay. Well, could you um put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time. I'm participant four I believe. Yes uh-huh. 'Kay. There we go. Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves, so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide. Cause that's where m my discussion starts. Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it. Um I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody, and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions. You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car, it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your C_D_ whatever you want it to do um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility. So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time, if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do. So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another, and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those. So that was um what I meant there, and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money, because if we're gonna sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present. Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present, and we want it to be an impulse purchase, we want somebody to see it and think it's, gee I just gotta have that. And take out their wallet and buy it. So it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by September, 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around, isn't gonna sell for Christmas. Um and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view. So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you, and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know, what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle, 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle. A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever. Okay can we go to the next slide please? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything. I'd like the suggestions to be really specific, so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off, not something like you know whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the T_V_, the V_C_R_, the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp. I have to wind up? Yeah, sure. Okay. Okay. Of course, yeah. Okay, so that's something Okay so Okay. Alright, thanks for that. Um alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now. 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use, and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room. Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address, uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible, we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use, and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep, and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate. 'Kay can we go to the next slide please? Okay, so, my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle. That is the selling point, the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase. Uh because once there's no be-back, well in sales they always say you know, be-backs don't come back. If somebody says, oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead. They're never gonna come back and buy it. You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing. And, in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use. We have to have as few buttons as possible, because more buttons is more confusion, so that's why I'm saying, simplicity is good. Finding it's important, obviously you can't use it if you can't find it. So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it, and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here, it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros. So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say, uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that. Has to be so great that they're gonna say, uh twenty five Euros isn't much. Um and then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign. Okay that's uh about it for me right now. Okay. Mm-hmm. Signal. Mm-hmm. Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook. Mm okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well we already eliminated that. Now that's good from a marketing point of view, the fun the fun shape. And that you you say that won't add too much to the budget? To d the shape is uh Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes? Is that gonna be a possible? 'Cause that might help with the marketing. Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is. Mm. Well, I think I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature. Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one. The changing modes was something I mean you and I, all f all four of us we work with computers all the time, changing modes is nothing for us, but people who N and And that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel, and um you don't feel the mode change. So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too. You know, like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels, so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it. But we'll get to that with you. That's right, yeah. Now that's a good point. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's a good that's a good one, because the clock would be really friendly, and and when is your favourite show coming on and Yeah, and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen, and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute. Yeah that's that's good, the clock is good. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Case. So it um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there? Or Okay. Okay. So it might be helpful if we had a look at that. Okay, thank you. Could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up Betsy? Yeah, okay, thank you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm, 'kay. And an alarm clock, yeah that should that should be okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well you know there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone. So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull. Mm-hmm. That's right. You can make a banana shaped one. Mm-hmm. Respect. Mm. What about the electronics? That's not really gonna change much, is it? That that w that won't change much, will it uh? I d I wouldn't think so. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right, and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes? Um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case. And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it? Um you as an industrial person? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well there's a real idea yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right. Mm-hmm. Uh yeah. An alternate package. Yeah. Okay. Well I think we can only aff, yeah. Cosmetic. Warning, finish meeting now. Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um Mm-hmm. Okay but we have to l Okay, fair enough. Okay.Yeah? Mm? Open. And then full screen. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Complicated, yeah, of course. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah 'kay. Yeah yeah sure. Thank you. Number two, yeah. Yeah exactly. Uh can you make it uh full screen please? No, it's like a well you you have to press here. The cup cup shape here? The thir third. Yeah exactly. Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller. Um can you go to the next sli slide please? The metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller. It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that. It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device, like a T_V_ or a air conditioner, something like that so. Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device. If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is. It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal, and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that, change the volume control and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices. Uh yeah. Um. So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there. So uh you can control whatever you want, you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions. So can you go to the next slide please? So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also, it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark. And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action, there can be no action taking to that so. And there should be a child lock, like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller. If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible but it uh yeah yeah yeah so it's it's okay, yeah, yeah. And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands and um so that uh Yeah, yeah, yeah and colours also, different colours, and No no no, it won't uh I don't think it will be like, you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more Yeah yeah. It's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter. Yeah. Yeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah. Yeah that will be Yeah yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, for children, yeah exactly. Yeah, that's what, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons. If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated. If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive, so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations, like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel, if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour. So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so. Yep, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's like you know yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yes. Yeah, yeah you don't us yeah yeah, usually. Yeah. Yeah shapes also, different shapes. Yeah that will Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh So yeah. And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's Yeah, and we display a clock. Yeah. Yeah, and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so Yeah. Yeah. Uh can you go to the next slide please? Uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch. And uh bulbs. Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T_V_ is on suppose, then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light. Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source, not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light. Maybe we can have that. Whenever the T_V_ is on, remote controller will have a light. And then uh infrared bulbs. Um this is like uh when it is dark. And battery, there should be a battery for power supply, and a chip, chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations, and wires connecting all chips, which is uh lights, everything, so there should be wires. And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and, you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape. Yeah. Yeah, holder. Um uh can you move onto the next slide. Um next sli slide please. Um I have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website, uh from where I have uh uh I got s few points. That's it, that's it from me now. Um. Uh it's not like that, I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so. Yeah if you want. Yeah, it's okay. Uh, it's actually there now, there on the screen. Mm. Yeah, sure. If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock. Hmm. It's like a t okay, it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television. Mm, T_V_, yeah. Don't T_V_, yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. We can design different remotes for different people, like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know. yeah. Children and everybody, yeah. Yeah of course that we can do, but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children, like in a different you know. No, it it doesn't cost, yeah. Yeah. Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter. Yeah. Hmm hmm. Uh no. Mm, I I I don't think no. It's not. Hmm. Yeah, like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers, like designs and all so that w we can have that. Yeah. Yeah, but uh Yeah. Yeah, maybe, yeah, yeah. If we do some more research, maybe we. Hmm yeah, I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah. Mm-hmm.

18	Oops. Mm. After lunch. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Yep. 'Kay. Yep. Fine. It's okay with me. Yep. Regarding those sizes, which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also, so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space. Uh Right. Night. And are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery, it like it runs for long time? Mm-hmm. Okay. We c Solar would be slightly expensives. It's twelve point f Another question is like sorry. W w which one would last the longest, because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day. A remote control, like, so we have to s look at the life also. Okay. So Mm-hmm. Okay. Second thing is yeah and second question is like, a mobile you can change the cover, you call it a skin or whatever. So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green, parrot green to chilli red or something like that. So is that feature available in like uh titanium, or it's like only specific to plastic or Mm-hmm. Yeah. Something like Alright. That could be a good idea. It could it would be comfortable to hold on also. Sorry I didn't get the last part, you're talking of Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely, you're saying like Uh-huh. Okay. 'Kay. Absolutely, f for somebody who very often, if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like, if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever. And just one small question before like you are, regarding the circuit, since we are hav having a flip-top, we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing, so we can divide the circuit like you know. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay, uh would like to share something which I did here. First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting, especially from the marketing and industrial design, to check on the customer needs and feasibility. Second is we checked into competitors, the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here. So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh, people need trendy, they are bored of black and white. So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here. And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here. No particular remote is standard. Like, some some people have a Here you see this? This is on a I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control, rest other buttons, they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all. Okay, and second as already discussed with William, we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top and g graphic user interface basically which is what we d do in computer, have icons or touch pad or whatever, which is Like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface. So basically not point or click Press any particular device, he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify. And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device, that means the use of button. So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer. So we are having a combination of boards, so f on the s simpler board, on the top we have this button, rubber buttons, to keep frequently changing the channels. But Mm-hmm. Okay and you mean to the And the lower distance. Oh f perfect. So the findings are too many cluttered buttons. Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained, example the volume and channel control buttons. All are confusing and in inconsistent. Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it. So it could be like, where is the remote, and the remote answers I am here. Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also? And technologically innovative also. So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this. My personal preferences would be like, as already uh marketing department, they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit, but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, uh red chilli uh tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have, like for example, i if you see the previous slide uh I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern, here, so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls. This is central one, the one you yeah volume and channel. So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models, if you look at all the models, it's here. This and voice recognition. The kinetic. Mm-hmm. Maybe we could start with the black and white. That that way we could upgrade later. Mm. Mm. Yeah. And for the sorry. For the body design I think plastic, uh w yeah we could use the body, for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip, something like to add to the design. Plast right. It's Uh I it's different. Right. Acupressure, you could talk of acupressures. And finally the body should be retouchable, may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside, it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time. Okay. The rubber. Fine. Yeah. Fine, uh we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost. So, are we looking at voice? Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains. For l yeah, the whistle. So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle. Yep. Uh sorry I didn't mention this, but we'll be incorporating in the design. Fine. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Again a questionnaire huh? I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now.I'll wait until you're all um hooked up. Okay. Put it on in that way. Thanks. Okay. Welcome back everybody, hope you've had fun. Right um this is our conceptual design meeting, um I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting, I th I I think yeah um. This is where we talk about um properties, materials, user-interface and trend-watching. So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already, but we'll just go over it. Um the minutes from the last time. Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext, it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow. Um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition, we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal. We were thinking a shell, but something along those lines, just a different shape from what's normal, um. You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost, things like that, um and our market was going to be young, business, kind of range. Okay, so shall we start with the first presentation? Yes if you feel It's okay. Yeah. Okay thank you very much. Um let's start from the inside and work our way out. I don't think so, not yet. Um, yes, thank you. I hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them. Okay. 'Kay.. 'Kay. Wa can you explain that? Like a right, okay. How what kind of how l long can you get out of that, I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night? Or That doesn't count though does it? I thought it was U_V_ like Any, any I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun. Uh, I don't think it counts electric lights no, but I mean not many you don't want to limit your market. I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people, but there are people. Mm, but then it would be charging through the day, I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening. Okay. Yeah I've seen But then if you think about a watch, it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time so you're walking around, you're doing things, it is moving a lot of the time. If you'd I mean you switch the T_V_ on, then you put it on the side, then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side. Is it really gonna be enough? Okay. So it's not the draw on it isn't Okay. Like a dual kind of. Expensive as well. What kind of price are we looking at for I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest? Solar. Well they're not designed Practical-wise okay. You do get a bit of wear but don't calculators have a battery in them as well? Mm. Okay, can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature? Can we think about that? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's Well add it in to think about um because, where am I? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less, you you wouldn't lose it so much. But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls. No. Okay. Okay, right. Mm-hmm. What kind of things do we have to consider there? Can we what kind of size, does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Hinged, yeah. So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off would be the rubber, like those pens that you get with the grip, that you can you can pull that off. Okay. Mm. Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh it would be flat inside. Mm. I think it would be good to have a contrast between, if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside. Now how would you distinguish, if you had it bare, how would you distinguish where you had to press, I mean Uh Like one of the palm pop thing. It would have to be attached. Okay, we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that. That's you, right okay. No. We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women. Well it's a remote control, you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ Yeah, no, no. Mm. Okay. Okay, okay. Mm. Mm. Okay. Which means Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part? 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press, just like a mobile phone. Yeah. That's what I was just saying, and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls, so have the um the volume and the programme, things like that, on the lower side. Okay. I can't see that, is that play and stop and things? Or is that volume and channel? Okay. Right. Okay. Um I'm not sure how long we've got left, but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed. So, we agree on Do we agree on the battery? Yeah. Um, that means that there's no function for li the port, you know that it sits in, then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it. It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget, it's a selling point. I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, but I think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things. The L_C_D_'s not cheap. Yeah, okay. And you could yeah. Okay. Do you want like a back-up? Um, okay so we've got battery. The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it? So there's not a really a decision to be made there, um. The buttons what did you give us as our The bare-board L_C_D_ or On the top one okay you've got the touch okay and then Okay, okay. No, it's fine. For the inside. Mm-hmm. Oh I think so, I think so. No I think I we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it um psychedelic, you know, we could make it black and white zebra stripes, but that's not really what we're focusing on, what we're focusing on is the m you know yes. So we could just pick anything. It's just different it's just different from everything else and I mean, I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses, sort of beige and black um so you either want something that goes with that, which is what's on the market anyway, or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and Mm. And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do, you could have um a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little Mm. And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes y you know, you could just go so far with it, like a puffer fish, you could just, you could take it wherever, so I think that's quite a flexible thing. Yes. Mm. Yeah. Okay we've got five minutes, um, or that might've been up for a while. Mm-hmm. Have you Okay. Well they do, but I think we can you could well it is, it is, I think you just address that with um advertising. Um, you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you. Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything, but everything else has a logo on it. The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does, without that so I'm not worried about that. Depending on how i I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into, so um that seems to make sense, but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else, then it's worth thinking about. But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards. Right I'm going to wrap it up there. I got a end meeting now message on my mo yeah so. Um so I think we've probably got it says, closing we have forty minutes so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back. It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took. Is everyone happy? Okay.Yeah, yeah I was getting that impression as well. Etcetera. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. That screwed in? Yeah. 'Kay, Okay. Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. Okay, first uh the Into the method. The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find. Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials, 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. Um, findings, I've got my nice little picture there. This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals, based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment. Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options. There's um actually no rechargeable option available, so we I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment, dynamo charging, I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest, people won't it's it's basically like wind-up radio. So you wind up your remote control before you use it. It might You Yeah, yeah, oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long, but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options, like the the solar charging, 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_. No. Is it? Alright i Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up. Yeah, okay. But Yeah and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway. But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway. The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches and you d you don't even notice it. I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up, I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work. Um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery, 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches. And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out. Yeah. Yeah and Yeah but then again I I think it is because if you think about it, the watch, although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side. And th for the same the same reason, you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it and you put it no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be Mm. Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because, if you lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical. They're they're expensive, they don't Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones, um but the It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping, 'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff, so. Y I think yeah, practically. I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do, they can t Yeah they do, they yeah they've got dual things, but they're the batteries are smaller I think. Mm. W m yeah so the Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging, um, I don't think you'd I think the it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last. Yeah I think i I think it would, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, well I'll move on. Um, my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board, which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button, it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts. Well well this the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in. If you if you see how thin the tracks are, you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one, if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that, or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit so that And then to uh yeah, so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used. Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things, they've got little lights on behind the buttons, so you can see what all the buttons are, like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote, but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off, if we decided to go for buttons that could light up. Um, the case material, I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us, the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical. Titanium um very expensive just to process, which to make it is expensive, and rubber, well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year, so perhaps uh some something made of rubber, but I was thinking more of the buttons, because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_. I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said. Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case. If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape, whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes. But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units for the flip phone. Yeah. Yeah I th Uh. Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really, the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium, it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it, because of the expense of how much titanium is is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote. Yeah, yeah. Rubber, yeah. And you can peel them off yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. T Yeah. Also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons, the I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen. Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough, that would be one option. Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons, but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space, two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch display. Uh what what Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it, but um you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off, you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_, you'd only have that with the printed circuit board. With W also with the Yeah. You could have a flat screen inside, yeah, but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside. It wouldn't be like full colour, it would just be black and white, but there'd be touch touch buttons, so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em, w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_. Is rubber. Mm. Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest. Yeah you could, you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but I I think they could get a bit easily lost, 'cause I had Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah okay. Yeah that's yeah that that's the end of m my Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple, I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them, 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking. Mm. Um. Yeah. I mean you can you could do it, you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out, but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it, I'm not sure about Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah but you can do it with your thumb li Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah we Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah I think I mean if Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock, then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them, uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them. So do you reckon that's a good idea that, where's the remote, I'm here thing? I think that would be quite fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one, I mean they use them in calculators so. Yeah. Well you cou um. K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch. So it's a lot smaller, so it would Yeah. Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one, on the buttons, on the on the on on the top one we're gonna yeah. On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones, the anti-R_S_I_ ones. Um, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. Plastic, okay. Yeah. Mm no. Mm. You can you can just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual uh plastic outside case, just the rubber thing that goes round the outside. Oh yeah, yeah the whistle ones, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, depending on the expense of it. And they've got in stock, so yeah. Yeah. Okay. Did it?Oh good grief. 'Kay. Oh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Shall I? Okay. We just connect up. Thank you. There we go. Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching. Um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch, sorry Project Manager. Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later. So that was one of the first things we did. Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel, rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls. They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative, and of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important, is twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important, but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at. Okay, um, now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group, um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there, that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials, uh again in contrast to last year. So a lot of interesting feedback there, both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan. Be interesting to see what our design people make of that. Unless anyone has any questions about that? Not yet? 'Kay. Okay. I know. Does does light charge as as sunlight does? Artificial light? Has to be solar. Mm. Artificial light, no. That's going to I know, different parts of the world too, if we're if we're marketing internationally. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Could I just ask referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with um standard batteries? I mean, could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible? Mm. So that affects the exterior design. Mm. Again it de Mm. It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature, i it's not gonna add anything, okay. Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally right, okay. It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research, it's not a thing that people are looking for when we threw it open to the field yeah. But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe. Mm. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall. I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it. I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over, that would give the spongy feel, that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone. Like a rubber sleeve almost, yeah. Mm. Mm. Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to. Mm. Yeah. Mm. I don't s sorry to interrupt, I don't see why the curved thing is a problem, if we for example had a shell, once we open that yeah, so it'd be f yeah, yeah. Have I misunderstood you? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I just had another idea, I don't know if it helps with that, but just to do with the R_S_I_. Is it possible, just as an option, when we open it up, people can use their fingers to press the button, or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to. Mm. Yeah. They're easy to replace as well, cheap. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got, couldn't they? A pencil or a pen, so they wouldn't really need a Mm-hmm. I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me, it kind of applies to both our designers here, so I'm not sure how it would fit in. If we flip open, now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display, you seen those? And they kind of respond to the turn of your body. Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing. They don't look at themselves? Just a thought. Yeah. I know what you mean, it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think, okay. trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but maybe we'll leave that one on the side. 'Kay. Mm. Oh I think forget about the mirror that was just a very quick passing thought yeah. Sorry what does that stand for? Okay. No you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be Wouldn't you? Isn't that the idea? You us if we just use the shell as an example again, you open that, you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm. Mm. Kinetic? Mm. Mm. Hmm. Yeah, we talked about kinetic charging, we've deci seem to have decided on that, did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries? No, one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they? I oh I see. Right, okay, got you. Got you on that okay, didn't realise. Sorry could you repeat that last part? L_C_D_ screen. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm, so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, okay. and it is just uh although it's rubberised and spongy, apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours, we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed, just go for the colours. Okay. Mm-hmm. The feel. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that, maybe about that size, made of plastic, fits into the palm of the hand, rubberised cover that's spongy. Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted, market research, is that fancy? Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else, but I mean I totally agree. We looked at those remotes, I mean they are kind of anonymous, very similar looking things. This would definitely be different enough, I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce, that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on, which is another beauty of it. Mm, so can I just recap uh Sarah, for the decisions that we've made, kinetic charging, the watch-type batteries, um L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top, rubberised buttons on the bottom side, we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover, the case itself is plastic. That's how far we've got, what else do we have to add to our decisions here? Mm. Yes, it was just, there was just a cost issue with that, but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost, is that right? And incorporating the company logo? Mm. 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report, it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere, they do want it to be obvious that it's our product don't they? Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper, I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location, have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then?

The Project Manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting. The Marketing Expert made a presentation on trend watching, including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion. The Industrial Designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available. He suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials. The User Interface Designer presented his main interface design, which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the LCD screen for other functions, to keep frequently used features easy to use. He announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider, depending on price. The Project Manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design. It was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery, that the remote will feature an LCD screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons, and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available. Speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly. 
19	Right uh. So um. So where's the PowerPoint presentation? Sorry? Microsoft PowerPoint, right. Right, okay. So. Right. Okay, so we've got uh so we've got new project requirements. Um. So basically we've got three things, and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options. Um. Three presentations. I see, right. That's nice to know, one from each of you. Um new project requirements. Um so do we want to do the presentation first, or do we want to um W I I got um or or three things basically, um relating to the remote being only for T_V_. We discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway. So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense. Um we've got uh teletext outdated. Um did you get any information on that? Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing. So I I got that in email form. Um. Right okay. So I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations. So we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh Sorry, yep. Oh. it going? Okay. Uh there's the rubber on the right, I think. it's magic. So the the top bit's the power source, yes?. So the battery is the in the sender. Okay. So, now more design. That's what we like to hear. Is it control function ei Oh, th there you go. Well there's a couple of things there. Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme. So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product. I haven't as yet, no. But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan. So uh I'm guessing that uh uh I notice on the bottom there it's got uh what's that? A_P_O_G_E_E_ that might be the corporate colour scheme, although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red. Well b uh w Well th the on the Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time, and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels. But but But, well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place, certainly the button up and down, but uh I mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for? I would have thought that uh it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard, you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others. So I would've thought that we wouldn't, you know, rather Okay, if the time of flicking from one to other, but presumably it'll take a second 'cause you have to be able to stop it. Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise. Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred, you could go one to one to ten, ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time. Anyway. Whatever. Okay. Okay. Limit the number of buttons, user friendly. Yeah. Well that's true, yeah, you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever, that that makes sense. Yeah. Does. So w so what was the circular thing that you were If it's just for T_V_, which is what it is at the moment. Mm-hmm. Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations. I'm I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing, or was I meant to give you that information? Right. Right, okay, so basically time to market seems to be important, therefore speed of delivery. We've only got about another four hours left. Yeah, I think she said twenty seconds to um What was that last wee bit there? Speech recognition, right okay. But that was only for young people that preferred it, older people didn't. Well that's right. Sounds reasonable. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing, you know without sound recognition. But if you I know. Um I was gonna say a sharp noise, you know a clapping of hand or whatever. You'd want to try and av just have the one product that if Yeah. Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command, a set command whatever that happened to be. But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then Mm. So uh Any sugges Well, any conclusions? Well if it does then we can't. It's that simple, because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had The design logo was one, which we've already mentioned. We've got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly. And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned, um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet. So that means that uh so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project. So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out. So anything that uh is to be added, such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical. S It would. But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras. Added extras would be nice, but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window, which effectively now is sort of four hours. So and if and we've gotta get to the end. Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible. Okay. Right okay, uh so I need to Right. So I don't know how long we have left of our uh time. But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is. We'll also know w when the next meeting is I um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task. And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes, we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this, this is how far we've progressed. Does that make reasonable sense? So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing. And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting, if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process, then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting. Do it via the email so that rather than coming you know If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine. Come along with it in the next meeting, we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate. But if you get it well before the next meeting, let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting. Okay. Right, is there I would guess so. Yep. I w well uh i Something simple. Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time, time's short, you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product, something that's quick and simple. So, sounds good. Well, so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do, now something that doesn't like whis uh Well I I I don't know. Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine, then go for that option, but if I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle, so uh so clap option. Okay. Uh. Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying, that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext, so so take out teletext. Yeah. No. But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic and if it is at the moment, that's fine. But at the moment it's not, so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters, 'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable, or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is And it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale, so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech. Possibly. That's right. Okay, well. Mm. So y Ah That's a very good idea. So you keep um Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting, so I've been told. I don't know if you've got the same. Okay. So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back. Ah. Mm-hmm. That's right. data functions hidden at back. Can bring out when needed. That's right so we're dis So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back. We have to decide. I guess so. So on front, numbers, volume. Sorry? Mm. Mm-hmm. So so are you having the stand-by on the front, then? Well. Channel up and down. What else have we got? What was that, sixteen? Volume button. How many volumes? Right okay. Power button, stand-by, channel, up and down. So is that it? Okay. That's sixteen buttons, you reckon. And then at the back? Okay. So on the back it'll have brightness, contrast, anything else? You're also gonna have the channel tuner, as it were. Tuner, would that have up and down?. okay. Okay. Um up volume, yeah, I would have thought so. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well you might get some research. Okay. Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting. And we'll meet back at I'm not sure. Um forty minutes, I believe is the time. Come on.Yeah. No. What is it? I think you've got to do um control F_ eight. Shift F_ eight. Ah there, it's doing something. I think it's that little Right. Thank you. Mine's not quite as complicated as all that. Did I press function? Yeah. Oh. Um. Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design. I'm Louisa, the User Interface Designer, as you know. Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set, so that a desired function is performed. Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down, uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that. Um to change the channel, either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down. Um to switch the television on or off, maybe a standby button. Um here are two example remotes. Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward, rewind functions, so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about. Uh but as you can see, the left remote is quite um quite busy looking, quite complicated. Um whereas the right remote is much simpler, it looks much more user friendly. Um so my personal preference would be the right remote. So, it's got nice big buttons, it's got a very limited number of buttons. Um they're nice, kinda clearly labelled. Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that. So it's very very user friendly, and it's got a little splash of colour. Could maybe do with some more colour. Um. Hmm. Do we get to see that? Will you be presenting that in a bit? Hmm. What do you mean by the circular section? Like all of that bottom bit? Yeah. Yeah. And I don't really think that you need nine numbers. I mean how often do you use seven, eight and nine? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough. Like how often do you hit nine? Hmm. Um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six, um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five. Hmm. Mm. Um. But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff, that would be tuned to one channel, and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels. Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers Yeah. But I suppose nine's not really excessive. I suppose it does make a good pattern. Okay. Um I think that's just for a video, so we wouldn't need any of that at all. Mm-hmm. Okay, so is everyone happy with that? Right well that's the end of my presentation. Do a lot of um There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at, I can't remember, and then they whistle back, or something like that. That'd probably be really simple, they're cheap. Yeah. Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function. 'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it. Yeah. I don't really know about the voice recognition thing. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either, 'cause everyone can whistle or clap, and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology. 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button, haven't we? Is that one of the Hmm. Right. Yeah, I think so, so zero to nine. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, like the volume or something. Yeah, 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well. My dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark, so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up. Well, if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well, have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down, so there's kind of um everything else revealed? So you don't use it that much, you don't have to see it all the time. But it's all there if you need it. Like a hidden panel. Hmm. And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause, well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu, but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly. Yeah. And the volume? Um. Yeah. Yeah I think they're handy. I know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here, but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity. Have you seen the adverts? Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste. If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time. Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby. Yeah, it's maybe too much of a big issue for here. Uh-oh danger sign. Yeah, but a little bit smaller. Compromise. Right. On mute. so. And then Mm-hmm. Uh there's audio functions. Yeah. I think they normally do. Yeah. So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio, surround sort of things. Um maybe for the younger market. Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel. Oh no, I mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them, like on the T_V_ remote. But I don't really know what they're for, I've never used them. I just know they're something to do with Dolby. Right.Yeah, I've got one too. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. There's usually a little thing in the top right for the Oh hang on, it's just coming on. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um I'm not sure. I had I've had some market information, but not from the company, no. Okay. 'Kay. I'm gonna pull this off. Uh-huh. Okay. I'll give it another go. Yeah, there we go. Right, we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control. And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and um how do people use it? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them. Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them, and what improvements would would they like to remote control. And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers. And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control, the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings, um they weren't used very often at all. People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons. Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control. And young people were quite receptive to this, but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older, people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition. There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well. Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it. And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control, it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions, and to find your way around it. Okay, so My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech A design which looks high-tech, basically. Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market, and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power, and also volume and that sort of thing, as as Louisa said. Um we could maybe come up with a menu, a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control. That's worth thinking about. Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well, because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design. That that might be the market that we're we're looking for. And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room, rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels. 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise, so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel. Okay um, and that's the end of the slide show. That's it. Cool. Um about speech recognition? Yeah. Youn young people pref Yeah, they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups, people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to, so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well, which which again would probably be a bit expensive, but Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control? Considering Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So About five minutes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yep. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So do we need to decide on the functions now? S Mm-hmm. Yeah and Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said, so. I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that, so. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No not everyone can whistle, can they, though? No, clapping, I think clapping, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Taking out teletext, okay. Mm. I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number, so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in, but that again is probably an expense that Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I s I suppose um if people are buying remotes, then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 'cause all most tellies come with remotes, so. I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions, so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in. Yeah, that would be a good idea, yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Uh I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one. So maybe next to each of the buttons, you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it, so you're basically pressing Right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So th the The detailed ones would be sort of brightness, uh sorta Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And probably a power one as well. Dunno. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick, so. Um. Numbers is ten, volume is twelve, th Yeah si One up, one down. And a mute, yeah. That's sixteen isn't it, yeah. I don't think so, no. You've got brightness and contrast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know, saying that you want that particular thing tuned in. So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Okay.We have a I guess we have a presentation each, 'cause I've got one. Um. Mm-hmm. Uh we didn't, no. I d I didn't personally. Okay that's fine. I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one. I'm not quite sure how it Control Doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment. Alt function F_ eight. Again not doing anything. Oh. pressed about five times now. Okay, that's me. Okay, um I have to go again. Hopefully that should be it this time. Okay, I think we're there. That's good. Okay, um Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design. Um of the of the remote control. Um I've just got three sections, first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um. And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote. Um so having researched the existing models within the market, um I found my research off the internet. Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function, actually are. And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television. Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply. Whether that'll be sort of two batteries, four batteries, um it may vary. We then have the user interface, which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote. Um the various functions used for changing channel, uh channel up and down, volume, things like that. Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things. And then the sender, which um is usually, I've found, an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television. Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself, because that's obviously found in the television.. Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working, so. I'll just go through there. S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with, or? Oh I'll j Oh I see. Oh okay. I'll get rid of the bear Okay that's great. Okay, so we start off with a um battery suppl Uh no, a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery. Um we then have a particular button, which may be that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons. Um but this is how the basic system works. Um that sends after you press that that sends the message to the chip, which um then sends It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender. Um. So that's. That's the remote in itself, that's the components of the remote and how they work together. So this is the uh user interface. Um this is the chip itself, which then, and that's the that's the infra-red sender. And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver. And the sender sends a message to the receiver. 'Kay. Ah yes, that's the power source. Um. going on to personal preferences, I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote, just because of the size. You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote. Um and then the sender, and infra-red um has been used quite successfully. If the battery's on reasonable power, they always seem to work fairly well. You don't have to be point directly at the television itself. Um Yes. 'Kay and that's it for the moment. Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here, the the sort of circular section, because that seems to be for a video as well. So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume. Possibly? J yeah yeah yeah j yeah just this little bit is that I think that's still um a video remote part, so maybe we could get rid of that as well. It's just people are used to seeing that, so if we didn't have them then they might think it's Hmm. Okay, yeah. I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number. So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need. Um. So we could get it down to what? So we get to How many buttons have we got? We've just got ten, eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need. I guess. Um which isn't really too many. That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote. 'Kay. 'Kay. Ah yes yes, that seems good. I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up. I'm sure we'll have by the end of today. Mm. No what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition. Um. And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone, you lose that and you can ring it. Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two. So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else, wherever the remote actually is. That is true, yes. Hmm. So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote. Yeah. Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device. you could have an option to turn it off. Or Perhaps, um. So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels. Mm. 'Kay. Yes. Has to be simple enough to I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes. Um. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Yes. Um. Yes that seems right. Mm-hmm. Okay. Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment, and if something comes back I'd go more Yeah, f more for clap. Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. Okay, ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow uh I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers. Or multiple digits. Did we decide anything about um the other functions? As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that? You had an had an idea about the menu? But just thinking um people probably I mean you don't have you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once, but you have to be able to tune it that once. So and if finally the T_V_ breaks, you get a new one, you're gonna have to be able to tune it. You can't really avoid that. Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves. So that'll be in Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. So how would this menu function work? Would you maybe have like one menu button, then you'd use the other buttons, maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions. Okay. we're gonna have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it, to guide Presu uh I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work. Right, okay um. that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two, and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it, so. That is that is a good idea actually. Sor sort of a second. Okay. Uh not quite, but I guess. Keep the other buttons but hide them away. So So um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well. So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists, I guess. So sh Should we decide in the next couple of minutes, and then So on the about the number. Um the volume up and down. Shall we have a mute button as well? A mute button as well. Yeah. Or But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one. 'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change. We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by. I think you probably should. Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons? Okay, so we'll have um So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there? Is there anything else? Um. Maybe if we're gonna run out of time, one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be. So tuner up and down, I guess. Um up Tune one way, tune the o I I dunno I dunno possibly. Oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select. Yeah, okay. Um I guess we're keeping s it simple. We don't really need any other audio funct uh functions because it's just volume up, volume down. Um. Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products, then, or do you have to do it via the remote? Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple. Oh, okay. Right. Um. Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think Well shall we look into that and just get back together.

The Project Manager gave the group new requirements on product features. The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the working design of the device. He presented all the necessary internal components and how they operate together. He gave his preferences on energy sources and senders. The User Interface Designer presented the necessary functions of the remote, then compared the interfaces of two existing remotes. The group discussed making their remote more user-friendly; they proposed eliminating rarely-used buttons and making it easier to skip through channels. The Marketing Expert discussed user requirements with the group and showed that users wanted a fancier, less complicated remote that would not be easily lost. He suggested incorporating a menu and an LCD screen to satisfy these requirements. The group discussed how to incorporate a locator function. The Project Manager reminded the group to limit the number of complicated features due to the project's time constraints. The group had a discussion to decide on product features. They decided to include a clapping locator function and a device that allows the user to enter two numbers separately to get a two-digit number. Complicated functions will be hidden in a back panel.
